* Experts fear low uptake of vaccine putting lives at risk

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The number of H1N1 swine flu deaths in Europe has doubled almost every two weeks since the middle of October and 169 people died of the virus in the past week, disease surveillance experts said on Monday.

The Stockholm-based European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said 670 deaths have been reported in Europe from H1N1 flu since they began monitoring it in April and all 31 European Union and European free trade area (EFTA) countries now have cases of the virus.

&quot;The numbers of deaths...has shown a steady increase -- almost doubling every fortnight over the last six weeks,&quot; it said in its daily update. &quot;While the most deaths have to date been in Western Europe there are increasing numbers of deaths being reported from central and eastern Europe.&quot;

Vaccination programmes against H1N1 have started in many European countries in recent weeks to try to halt the spread of the virus, which is commonly known as swine flu and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in June.

But immunisation plans are facing mixed levels of uptake and opposition from anti-vaccine lobbyists, according to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID). It said such opposition was putting &quot;public health and lives&quot; at risk.

&quot;No one can afford to be complacent or sceptical about the benefits of the H1N1 vaccine,&quot; ESCMID&apos;s president Javier Garau said in a statement. &quot;The serious consequences of skipping the flu jab must be considered...and physicians must make clear the safety and vital protection role the vaccine has to play.&quot;

The WHO said last week that governments across the world have administered more than 65 million H1N1 vaccine doses. Common side effects of the shots include swelling, redness or pain at the injection site, and sometimes fever or headache but the WHO ruled out any death links to the shots. [ID:nLJ604604]

The ECDC reported &quot;very high intensity&quot; of flu-like illness in the past week in Italy, Norway and Sweden and said intensity was &quot;high&quot; in Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland and Portugal. The rest of Europe had mainly &quot;medium&quot; intensity, it said.

The ESCMID said flu levels were &quot;unusually high for this time of year&quot;, with H1N1 accounting for 99 percent of cases.

It said it feared &quot;deliberate misinformation&quot; about H1N1 shots was being spread by a growing anti-vaccination movement and warned that a low uptake could hamper efforts to control the pandemic and increase pressure on health systems across Europe.

Some people say they fear the new H1N1 vaccines have been rushed through medicine regulation processes and not tested widely enough. But regulators, health experts and the WHO say the shots are safe, effective and offer vital protection.

&quot;No one should reject a safe and effective vaccine when we are dealing with an unpredictable virus capable of killing children and young adults in their prime,&quot; Garau said. (Editing by Diana Abdallah) ((kate.kelland@thomsonreuters.com; +44 (0)7990 567 059))</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The pandemic of swine flu may be hitting a peak in the Northern Hemisphere, global health officials said on Friday, but they cautioned it was far from over.

Officials also said they were investigating several troubling outbreaks of drug-resistant H1N1 but noted they were limited so far and that there were no indications yet the virus was mutating in a sustained way.

The World Health Organization said H1N1 flu was moving eastward across Europe and Asia after appearing to peak in parts of Western Europe and the United States.

At least 6,770 deaths have been recorded worldwide since the swine flu virus emerged in April -- but officials always stress the confirmed count represents only a fraction of the actual cases, as most patients never get tested.

There are &quot;early signs of a peak in disease activity in some areas of the northern hemisphere,&quot; the WHO said in a statement.

Transmission keeps intensifying in Canada, with the highest number of doctor visits by children. But U.S. officials saw signs of a slowdown.

SOME DECLINES

&quot;We are beginning to see some declines in flu activity around the country but there is still a lot of influenza,&quot; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat told a news conference.

&quot;It is still much greater than we would normally see this time of year.&quot;

A team at flu test maker Quest Diagnostics analyzed 142,000 U.S. flu tests and found a similar pattern, with tests showing a decline in flu-like illness since October 27.

WHO said Norway and countries farther east including Georgia, Lithuania, Moldova and Serbia were reporting sharp increases in influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection.

Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and parts of Afghanistan -- particularly the capital, Kabul -- are reporting higher numbers of flu cases. Israel is also reporting sharp increases.

&quot;Essentially what is happening is that it is spreading eastward,&quot; Anthony Mounts of WHO&apos;s influenza team told Reuters. &quot;Typically, seasonal influenza always starts west and moves eastward. It seems to be following that pattern except it is coming very early this year.&quot;

Influenza can hit several peaks in a single season. Experts said weeks or months more of disease could be expected and noted that during the 1957 pandemic, a busy autumn was followed by a lull and then infections surged again starting in January.

Vaccination campaigns are beginning in many countries but companies reported some trouble making vaccine from the H1N1 virus. The United States was still struggling to distribute vaccines but Canadian Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said enough vaccine for almost half of Canada&apos;s population would have been shipped out by the end of the next week.

MUTANT VIRUSES

British health officials said they were investigating the likely person-to-person spread of a drug-resistant strain of swine flu.

The Health Protection Agency reported five confirmed cases in Wales of patients infected with H1N1 resistant Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc&apos;s antiviral drug Tamiflu.

Another antiviral, GlaxoSmithKline and Biota Inc&apos;s Relenza, were effective in the patients, the HPA said.

The patients had serious conditions that suppressed their immune systems, which can give the virus a better than usual opportunity to develop resistance, the HPA added.

U.S. CDC officials also said they were investigating four cases of H1N1 resistant to Tamiflu at Duke University hospital in North Carolina. &quot;All four patients were very ill with underlying severely compromised immune systems and multiple other complex medical conditions,&quot; Duke said in a statement.

Health experts are looking for any sign that H1N1 is mutating into a drug-resistant form. Last year, the seasonal version of H1N1, a distant cousin of the pandemic strain, developed resistance to Tamiflu.

In Norway, officials were investigating a mutated strain in some patients that they said could be responsible for causing severe symptoms.

&quot;The mutation could be affecting the virus&apos; ability to go deeper into the respiratory system, thus causing more serious illness,&quot; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement.

WHO said the mutation did not appear to be widespread in Norway and the virus remained sensitive to antivirals and pandemic vaccines.

A similar mutation had been detected in H1N1 viruses in several other countries, including China and the United States, in severe as well as in some mild cases, it said.

    <body>* Saudis warn against politicising pilgrimage

* Pilgrim crowds offer chance for flu to spread

* Efforts to prevent deadly crush of pilgrims

RIYADH, Nov 23 (Reuters) - More than two million Muslims gather this week for the annual haj pilgrimage to Islam&apos;s holy city of Mecca, where Saudi authorities hope to minimise spread of the H1N1 virus and prevent any political demonstration.

The haj, one of the world&apos;s biggest displays of mass religious devotion and a duty for Muslims who can perform it, has been marred in the past by fires, hotel collapses, police clashes with protesters and deadly stampedes.

This year, the mainly Sunni Muslim kingdom is battling Shi&apos;ite Yemeni rebels after they raided its territory, an issue that raises fears of possible protests by fellow Shi&apos;ite Muslims during the rituals. Saudi Arabia bans public protests.

In 1987, a rally by pilgrims against Israel and the United States led to clashes with Saudi security forces in which 402 people, mostly Iranians, died.

Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally which sees itself as Sunni Islam&apos;s guardian, has often been at odds with Shi&apos;ite Iran, mainly after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

Riyadh warned earlier this month against any attempt to politicise the pilgrimage. The warning followed remarks by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to departing Shi&apos;ite pilgrims that they could not ignore conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories and Pakistan.

The haj should &quot;display the firm resolve of the Muslim nation to confront attempts that damage its unity and progress,&quot; Khamenei said.

Interior Minister Prince Nayef, whose country has been battling al Qaeda militants since 2003, said late on Sunday about 100,000 men are deployed to ensure security at holy sites. &quot;We hope we will not have to resort to force.&quot;

FLU SPREAD Riyadh is also trying to prevent a spread of the H1N1 virus as the crowded rituals provide an environment for transmission of the disease. At least four pilgrims have died of the virus since the beginning of the haj season.

Since the World Health Organization declared H1N1 a pandemic in June, experts fear pilgrims from some 160 countries would carry the virus initiating waves of outbreaks worldwide.

The Arabian Peninsula kingdom, the birthplace of Islam, has urged Muslims over 65 and under 12 as well as people with chronic diseases and pregnant women not to perform the ritual this year. Several countries have put restrictions on their pilgrims and Tunisia has banned citizens from going altogether.

Riyadh has installed devices to detect infections at points of entry and set up a 300-bed clinic in the Red Sea port of Jeddah where most foreign pilgrims arrive.

On the climax of the haj on Thursday, worshippers spend the day gathered en masse at Arafat near Mecca. The following day pilgrims begin casting stones at pillars over three days in a symbolic renunciation of the devil&apos;s temptation.

Authorities have improved facilities to ease the flow of pilgrims, particularly around the area where crowds gather to throw stones at the pillars. In 2006, 362 people were crushed to death there, the worst haj tragedy in 16 years.

Saudi Arabia has built a four-storey platform around the pillars to expand the access area. (Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Inal Ersan) ((ulf.laessing@reuters.com ; +966 1 463 2603; Reuters Messaging:ulf.laessingreuters.com@reuters.net))</body>

* New factory first in U.S. to use cells to make flu shots

* Novartis hopes U.S. market will accept boosted vaccines

* First dose won&apos;t come before 2011

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Novartis (NOVN.VX) will officially open the first next-generation flu vaccine plant in the United States on Tuesday, but it will be years before it makes its first vaccine.

The factory in Holly Springs, North Carolina, will use batches of dog cells to grow influenza vaccine, instead of the chicken eggs widely used now. While the cell method is only slightly faster, it can be scaled up more quickly.

Federal advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week asked for more safety data on another cell-based vaccine, one made by privately held Protein Sciences Corp. But U.S. officials said the new Novartis shot is not as experimental.

&quot;I see them as totally different. The whole point of pushing on cell culture was increasing capacity and surge capacity,&quot; Dr. Bruce Gellin, head of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department&apos;s National Vaccine Program Office, said in an interview.

HHS spent $487 million helping Novartis build the plant, which was planned before the current pandemic of H1N1 swine flu.

The U.S. government is struggling to vaccinate enough Americans against H1N1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 22 million Americans have been infected, and it wants to vaccinate at least 160 million people.

But just over 50 million H1N1 vaccines have been distributed.

When it gets up and going in 2011, Novartis says the Holly Springs facility will be able to make 50 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine a year and up to 150 million doses of pandemic vaccine within six months of a pandemic being declared.

That assumes that the pandemic vaccine contains an adjuvant -- an additive that boosts the body&apos;s response to a vaccine and lowers the dose needed.

Adjuvants are not licensed for U.S. use now, mostly because of widespread public suspicion of new vaccine ingredients.

ALTERNATIVE MARKETS

Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis, said the company will start making adjuvants at the new factory, anyway. The company&apos;s cell-based influenza vaccine made with an adjuvant was approved in Germany this month, so vaccine could be made in the United States for export to the European market, he said.

Novartis is among the flu vaccine makers frustrated by the U.S. government&apos;s refusal to use vaccines with adjuvants.

The Novartis cell-based vaccine needs only 3.75 micrograms of antigen, the active ingredient in a vaccine, compared to 15 micrograms for a vaccine made without antigen. So using an adjuvant could effectively quadruple vaccine supply.

European clinical trials have shown the adjuvants are safe and boost supply, but the FDA would require separate data to license a new vaccine.

&quot;We need clarity on why (the results of) European trials are not accepted in the United States,&quot; Althoff said in a telephone interview.

Dr. Scott Gottleib of the American Enterprise Institute says the new technology is faster and more predictable than using eggs. And the new factory is on U.S. soil.

&quot;We also lack domestic vaccine manufacturing facilities. In at least two cases we know of, this put the U.S. behind other countries in getting vaccine orders filled,&quot; Gottleib told Congress in written testimony earlier this week.

Gottleib said Canadian authorities had asked GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) to ensure it would fill Canadian orders from its factory in Quebec before filling the U.S. order for 7.6 million doses. Likewise, Australian vaccine maker CSL (CSL.AX) was asked to ensure the Australian supply before filling U.S. orders.

Sanofi Aventis (SASY.PA) has a flu vaccine plant in Pennsylvania, but other flu vaccines for the U.S. market are made in other countries.

Many experts have cautioned that in the event of a very serious pandemic, countries would be likely to seize any vaccines made within their own territories. (Editing by Julie Steenhuysen; editing by John Wallace) ((Maggie.Fox@ThomsonReuters.com; Washington bureau newsroom 202-898-8492))</body>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Novartis will officially open the first next-generation flu vaccine plant in the United States on Tuesday, but it will be years before it makes its first vaccine.

The factory in Holly Hill, North Carolina, will use batches of dog cells to grow influenza vaccine, instead of the chicken eggs widely used now. While the cell method is only slightly faster, it can be scaled up more quickly.

* All six people affected have recovered

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Some Canadian provinces have stopped using a particular batch of the H1N1 flu vaccine after six people experienced severe allergic reactions, the country&apos;s health agency said on Monday.

The Public Health Agency of Canada and vaccine manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) have asked the governments of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Prince Edward Island -- nearly half the country&apos;s 13 provinces and territories -- to stop using a batch of 172,000 doses.

Six allergic reactions from that size of a batch is a higher percentage than usual, said a spokeswoman for the Public Health Agency. Overall, the number of severe allergic reactions following H1N1 vaccinations is less than 1 per 100,000 doses, the norm for other vaccines.

All six people who experienced the allergic reactions have recovered, the spokeswoman said.

Manitoba received 63,000 doses of the vaccine batch and has only 930 left, a spokeswoman for the provincial health department said. Health officials have now placed all the remaining doses in storage.

People who were vaccinated from that batch have no reason for concern if they did not suffer an immediate allergic reaction, she said.

    <body>* Farm revenue down 4.2 pct first three quarters

* Income falls on softer grain prices, fewer exports

* Less farmer revenue hurts some ag companies

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Canadian farmers are earning less so far in 2009 as grain prices have slipped and the United States is buying less Canadian livestock, Statistics Canada said on Monday.

Farm cash receipts, which include crop and livestock revenues plus payments from government programs, dropped 4.2 percent to C$32.8 billion ($30.9 billion) from January through September compared with the same period a year ago.

Cash receipts don&apos;t measure a farm&apos;s bottom line, which also takes into account expenses such as loans, fertilizer and seed.

The drop in grain prices reflects a return to more normal market conditions after a run-up in 2008. Livestock farmers, meanwhile, have suffered from a U.S. food labeling law that has resulted in American packers importing fewer cattle and hogs.

Statscan also cited factors such as the strong Canadian dollar, which makes exports less attractive, and the H1N1 flu outbreak in spring, which resulted in some pork markets temporarily halting imports from Canada.

&quot;There&apos;s a lot of frustrated, disenchanted farmers out there,&quot; said Terry Boehm, a grains and oilseeds farmer at Colonsay, Saskatchewan and vice president of the National Farmers Union in Canada. &quot;They thought that after decades they were seeing some improvement in grain prices but they&apos;ve seen it snatched away pretty quickly.&quot;

Companies that sell farmers goods, ranging from seed and fertilizer to fenceposts and satellite technology, often see their own performance tied to farm income.

Nontraditional farming tools such as global-positioning systems are among those products that have fallen victim to farmers&apos; thriftiness. Hemisphere GPS (HEM.TO), a Canadian manufacturer of the farm technology, posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month on weak agricultural demand [ID:nBNG171787].

On the other hand, Rocky Mountain Dealerships (RME.TO), a Canadian dealer of farm and construction equipment, recorded higher-than-expected earnings this month, thanks in part to strength in its agricultural market [ID:nN10391843].

A modest 1.9 percent increase in farm cash receipts from the supply-managed dairy and poultry sectors eased the overall decline for the livestock industry.

Statscan also said on Monday that farmers&apos; net income rose in 2008 for a second straight year, to C$3.6 billion. That was a sharp 79 percent jump from 2007 because of spiking grain and oilseed prices, Statscan said.

Four people have died so far in the Czech Republic in swine flu-related cases, including three who already had serious health problems. So far 632 people have been infected in the country of 10.5 million.

The government bought 1 million vaccines in August from GlaxoSmithKline for army and top state officials, healthcare staff and the chronically ill.

The first 95,000 vaccines were distributed at the weekend, with another 90,000 to arrive in December and the rest next year, the ministry said.

    <body>BUDAPEST, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Santa Claus should avoid kissing children and shaking their hands to prevent spreading the flu and should get vaccinated against the illness, Hungary&apos;s state health authority said.

In a recommendation issued over the weekend and posted on its official website www.antsz.hu, the authority did not ban traditional Santa Claus activities but warned of increased risks of contagion due to a nationwide flu epidemic.

In Hungary, Santa Claus traditionally comes on Dec. 6, when children find gifts in shoes placed on window sills the night before.

&quot;For Santa Clauses, prevention is especially important as they meet lots of children in early December, and therefore they face a high risk of infection,&quot; the authority said.

&quot;If Santa Claus is elderly, overweight or has a chronic illness, and therefore belongs to a high risk group concerning the flu ... then getting a vaccination against the flu is particularly important,&quot; it added.

    <body>By Hamid Shalizi

KABUL, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Afghan children returned to school wearing medical face masks on Sunday after a three-week closure ordered by the government to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus.

Schools will be open for 20 days so pupils can sit exams before closing for the winter holiday, Education Ministry spokesman Attah Mohammad Qaneh said.

The government advised parents to send children to school in face masks and to keep them home if they are even slightly ill, said Health Ministry spokesman Dr Ahmad Farid Raeed.

&quot;I have to pass my exams to advance to fourth grade, and I am happy that schools are open again,&quot; Parwin, a 10-year-old Kabul girl, told Reuters. &quot;I won&apos;t take off my mask and I won&apos;t eat anything at school.&quot;

Her father, Ahmad Zia, said he had ordered his two daughters not to remove their masks.

&quot;I don&apos;t know whether this disease is dangerous but we should take precautions,&quot; he said.

H1N1, commonly called swine flu, spreads easily and can be dangerous for children, especially if they suffer from other health problems.

Afghanistan declared a health emergency earlier this month and ordered all private and government educational institutions and kindergartens closed to help prevent the spread of H1N1 after attributing its first death to the virus.

The Health Ministry said then that it had detected 350 cases of H1N1 and several hundred more people were suspected of being infected.

But Ahmad Bashir, a shopkeeper, said he believed the closures were a plot by the authorities to try to avoid public demonstrations during the disputed re-election of President Hamid Karzai, who was inaugurated last week.

&quot;It was a political manoeuvre to prevent any protest against Karzai&apos;s re-election,&quot; he said, but added: &quot;I told my son to put on a mask, just in case.&quot; (Writing by Peter Graff; Editing by Janet Lawrence) (For more Reuters coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan, see: here) ((E-mail: peter.graff@thomsonreuters.com; Reuters Messaging: peter.graff.reuters.com@reuters.net; Kabul newsroom: +93 799 335 284)) (If you have a query or comment about this story, send an e-mail to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com)</body>

    <body>RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Saturday four pilgrims had died of the new H1N1 flu virus three days before the massive Muslim haj is due to begin, al-Hayat newspaper said.

The Health Ministry said the deaths were among pilgrims who came from outside Saudi Arabia, al-Hayat online news said.

Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Mirghalani could not be immediately reached for comment.

Some 3 million Muslim pilgrims take part in the haj in the holy city of Mecca every year, including up to 2 million who travel from abroad. Haj rituals this year start on Wednesday.

Disease experts from the United States and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, say that waves of H1N1 flu virus spread by pilgrims traveling to and from Mecca for this year&apos;s haj threaten to put pressure on healthcare systems around the world.

The pilgrimage provides perfect conditions for the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, which is transmitted by sneezing and physical contact.

By Huang Yan and Lucy Hornby

BEIJING, Nov 20 (Reuters) - China has promised severe punishment for officials caught concealing deaths from H1N1 swine flu after a medical expert said suspect cases may have been held back by local governments.

The Health Ministry said China had adopted a new H1N1 accounting method earlier this month. If a person was confirmed with H1N1 and then died, the case should be reported as death from H1N1, whether or not there was another condition.

&quot;People responsible will be punished if reports of H1N1 virus cases are held back, lied about or delayed,&quot; said Deng Haihua, spokesman for China&apos;s Health Ministry, according to a notice on the ministry&apos;s website (www.moh.gov.cn) seen on Friday.

Zhong Nanshan, respected by many in China for his candour and work fighting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, said he did not believe the national H1N1 death toll of 53, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported on Thursday.

Zhong, who heads the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases in southern China, said that &quot;some areas have not been testing deaths from severe (pneumonia) and treating them as cases of ordinary pneumonia without any question&quot;.

The World Health Organisation does not have a standard for which deaths to attribute to H1N1, although it does define how to diagnose cases, spokeswoman Vivian Tan said from Beijing.

&quot;We don&apos;t think anything unusual is happening here, in terms of how the virus is spreading or how virulent it is,&quot; Tan said.

The H1N1 flu strain affects the respiratory tract. Patients who become severely ill or die typically suffer from pneumonia, either brought on directly by the virus or due to secondary bacterial infections.

The World Health Organisation reported more than 503,536 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 worldwide on Nov. 8, with at least 6,260 deaths. However, it has stressed for months now that the figures were only the tip of the iceberg.

It urged countries to place more resources on mitigating the disease rather then on costly prevention measures or testing everyone. All WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will say is that &quot;millions&quot; have been infected.

China&apos;s previous method attributed the death to previously existing conditions but not to H1N1, thereby reducing the number of cases reported as H1N1 death cases, a separate notice on the Health Ministry&apos;s website said.

A ministry official told Reuters it would no longer issue cumulative tolls, only new cases and deaths.

That will make it difficult to determine the actual extent of H1N1 deaths in China, which based on previous figures have been statistically much lower than in other countries. (Additional reporting by Tan Ee Lyn in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)</body>

    <body>* 3 H1N1 cases found with potentially significant mutation * Two cases found among first fatalities in Norway

* Says disease&apos;s mutation could cause more serious illness

* WHO says mutated virus sensitive to antivirals, vaccines

(Adds WHO statement in new paras 4-6; CDC comment paras 15-17)

OSLO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Norwegian health authorities said on Friday they have discovered a potentially significant mutation in the H1N1 influenza strain that could be responsible for causing the severest symptoms among those infected.

&quot;The mutation could be affecting the virus&apos; ability to go deeper into the respiratory system, thus causing more serious illness,&quot; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement.

There was no reason to believe the mutation had any implication for the effectiveness of flu vaccines or antiviral drugs made by groups such as Roche (ROG.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Novartis (NOVN.VX) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L), the authorities said.

The World Health Organisation said that the mutation did not appear to be widespread in Norway and the virus in its mutated form remained sensitive to antivirals and pandemic vaccines.

A similar mutation had been detected in H1N1 viruses circulating in several other countries, including China and the United States, in severe as well as in some mild cases, it said.

&quot;Although further investigation is under way, no evidence currently suggests that these mutations are leading to an unusual increase in the number of H1N1 infections or a greater number of severe or fatal cases,&quot; the WHO said in a statement.

H1N1, a mixture of swine, bird and human viruses, has killed at least 6,770 people globally, according to its latest update.

In Norway the mutation was found in the bodies of two people killed by the virus and of one person made seriously ill. The two infected by the mutated virus who died were among the first fatalities from the H1N1 pandemic in Norway, the institute said.

It was unclear whether the mutated virus was transmitted among humans, the health authorities said.

&quot;Based on what we know so far, it doesn&apos;t seem like the mutated virus is circulating in the population, but rather that spontaneous changes have happened in the three patients,&quot; director Geir Stene Larsen at the public health institute said in the statement.

Norway has seen relatively more fatalities in the flu pandemic compared to the size of the population versus other European countries, with 23 confirmed deaths.

Public health authorities have said this could be due to the country being hit early in the pandemic&apos;s northern hemisphere winter wave, before a mass vaccination programme got underway.

&quot;Nevertheless, it is important to study if there&apos;s still something about the Norwegian fatalities that separate us from other countries, and that make us learn something that strengthens our treatment of the seriously ill,&quot; director Bjorn-Inge Larsen at the Norwegian Directorate of Health said.

Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, &quot;This mutation has been seen sporadically.&quot;

She said it is sometimes seen in patients who have mild influenza symptoms.

&quot;I think it is just too soon to say what this might mean long term,&quot; Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing. (Reporting by Richard Solem; Additional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva and Maggie Fox in Washington; Editing by Matthew Jones and Louise Ireland)</body>

    <body>* 3 H1N1 cases found with potentially significant mutation * Two cases found among first fatalities in Norway

* Says disease&apos;s mutation could cause more serious illness

* WHO says mutated virus sensitive to antivirals, vaccines

(Adds WHO statement in new paras 4-6; CDC comment paras 15-17)

OSLO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Norwegian health authorities said on Friday they have discovered a potentially significant mutation in the H1N1 influenza strain that could be responsible for causing the severest symptoms among those infected.

&quot;The mutation could be affecting the virus&apos; ability to go deeper into the respiratory system, thus causing more serious illness,&quot; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement.

There was no reason to believe the mutation had any implication for the effectiveness of flu vaccines or antiviral drugs made by groups such as Roche (ROG.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Novartis (NOVN.VX) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L), the authorities said.

The World Health Organisation said that the mutation did not appear to be widespread in Norway and the virus in its mutated form remained sensitive to antivirals and pandemic vaccines.

A similar mutation had been detected in H1N1 viruses circulating in several other countries, including China and the United States, in severe as well as in some mild cases, it said.

&quot;Although further investigation is under way, no evidence currently suggests that these mutations are leading to an unusual increase in the number of H1N1 infections or a greater number of severe or fatal cases,&quot; the WHO said in a statement.

H1N1, a mixture of swine, bird and human viruses, has killed at least 6,770 people globally, according to its latest update.

In Norway the mutation was found in the bodies of two people killed by the virus and of one person made seriously ill. The two infected by the mutated virus who died were among the first fatalities from the H1N1 pandemic in Norway, the institute said.

It was unclear whether the mutated virus was transmitted among humans, the health authorities said.

&quot;Based on what we know so far, it doesn&apos;t seem like the mutated virus is circulating in the population, but rather that spontaneous changes have happened in the three patients,&quot; director Geir Stene Larsen at the public health institute said in the statement.

Norway has seen relatively more fatalities in the flu pandemic compared to the size of the population versus other European countries, with 23 confirmed deaths.

Public health authorities have said this could be due to the country being hit early in the pandemic&apos;s northern hemisphere winter wave, before a mass vaccination programme got underway.

&quot;Nevertheless, it is important to study if there&apos;s still something about the Norwegian fatalities that separate us from other countries, and that make us learn something that strengthens our treatment of the seriously ill,&quot; director Bjorn-Inge Larsen at the Norwegian Directorate of Health said.

Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, &quot;This mutation has been seen sporadically.&quot;

She said it is sometimes seen in patients who have mild influenza symptoms.

&quot;I think it is just too soon to say what this might mean long term,&quot; Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing. (Reporting by Richard Solem; Additional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva and Maggie Fox in Washington; Editing by Matthew Jones and Louise Ireland)</body>

OSLO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Norwegian health authorities said on Friday they have discovered a potentially significant mutation in the H1N1 influenza strain that could be responsible for causing the severest symptoms among those infected.

&quot;The mutation could be affecting the virus&apos; ability to go deeper into the respiratory system, thus causing more serious illness,&quot; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement.

Authorities added they had no reason to believe the mutation had any implication for the effect of flu vaccines or antiviral drugs made by groups such as Roche (ROG.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Novartis (NOVN.VX) or AstraZeneca (AZN.L).

H1N1, a mixture of swine, bird and human viruses, has killed more than 7,000 people globally.

In Norway the mutation was found in the bodies of two people killed by the virus and of one person made seriously ill.

The two people infected by the mutated virus were among the first fatalities from the H1N1 pandemic in Norway, the institute said.

It was unclear whether the mutated virus was transmitted among humans, the health authorities said.

&quot;Based on what we know so far, it doesn&apos;t seem like the mutated virus is circulating in the population, but rather that spontaneous changes have happened in the three patients,&quot; director Geir Stene Larsen at the public health institute said in the statement.

In some later fatalities linked to H1N1 that were studied, the same mutation was not found. It had found other mutations in some other cases, but the mutations found in two of the first fatalities and one seriously ill patient had been of &quot;particular interest&quot;, it said.

Norway has seen relatively more fatalities in the flu pandemic compared to the size of the population versus other European countries, with 23 confirmed deaths.

Public health authorities have said this could be due to the country being hit early in the pandemic&apos;s northern hemisphere winter wave, before a mass vaccination programme got underway.

    <body>GENEVA (Reuters) - The H1N1 flu is moving eastwards across Europe and Asia after appearing to peak in parts of western Europe and the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.

At least 6,770 deaths have been recorded worldwide since the swine flu virus emerged in April, according to the latest WHO update which showed 520 known fatalities in the past week.

There are &quot;early signs of a peak in disease activity in some areas of the northern hemisphere,&quot; the WHO said in a statement.

H1N1 flu is still widespread across the United States although it appears to have recently peaked in most areas except the northeast. But transmission continues to intensify in Canada, with the highest number of doctor visits by children.

Spread of the flu appears to have peaked in western European countries including Belgium, Britain, Iceland and Ireland after a period of intense outbreaks, the United Nations agency said.

Norway and countries further east including Georgia, Lithuania, Moldova and Serbia are reporting sharp increases in influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection, it said.

Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and parts of Afghanistan -- particularly Kabul -- are reporting higher numbers of flu cases. Israel is also reporting sharp increases.

&quot;Essentially what is happening is that it is spreading eastwards,&quot; Anthony Mounts, medical epidemiologist on WHO&apos;s influenza team, told Reuters. &quot;Typically seasonal influenza always starts west and moves eastwards. It seems to be following that pattern except it is coming very early this year.&quot;

Flu transmission remains active in east Asia, the WHO said. &quot;In Japan, influenza activity remains elevated but stable nationally and may be decreasing slightly in populated urban areas,&quot; it said.

Most countries in tropical areas of central and South America continue to report declining numbers of flu cases, with the exception of Peru and Colombia, it said.

GENEVA, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The H1N1 flu is moving eastwards across Europe and Asia after appearing to peak in parts of western Europe and the United States, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday.

At least 6,770 deaths have been recorded worldwide since the swine flu virus emerged in April, according to the latest WHO update which showed 520 known fatalities in the past week.

* Agency still evaluating data on Baxter H1N1 vaccine

(Adds details on manufacturers, background)

LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - In a change of tack, Europe&apos;s drugs watchdog said on Friday that giving a single dose of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) Pandemrix or Novartis&apos;s (NOVN.VX) Focetria swine flu vaccines would suffice for most people.

The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) had previously said two doses were preferable, although many governments have already been pushing ahead with single-shot immunisation programmes for adults.

&quot;For both vaccines, a single dose may be used in adults aged between 18 and 60 years and in children and adolescents, from the age of nine years for Focetria and from 10 years for Pandemrix,&quot; the EMEA said in its latest statement following a monthly meeting of experts.

Focetria and Pandemrix can be also been given at the same time as seasonal flu vaccines, it added. The updated position follows a review of the latest clinical data.

In the case of Baxter International&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan, however, the agency said that the data were still being assessed. (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Greg Mahlich)</body>

* Disease may be on the wane in Northern Hemisphere

* New peaks could come at any time

* Drug-resistant strains not yet worrying

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The pandemic of swine flu may be hitting a peak in the Northern Hemisphere, global health officials said on Friday, but they cautioned it was far from over.

Officials also said they were investigating several troubling outbreaks of drug-resistant H1N1 but noted they were limited so far and that there were no indications yet the virus was mutating in a sustained way.

The World Health Organization said H1N1 flu was moving eastward across Europe and Asia after appearing to peak in parts of Western Europe and the United States. [ID:nLK457990]

At least 6,770 deaths have been recorded worldwide since the swine flu virus emerged in April -- but officials always stress the confirmed count represents only a fraction of the actual cases, as most patients never get tested.

There are &quot;early signs of a peak in disease activity in some areas of the northern hemisphere,&quot; the WHO said in a statement.

Transmission keeps intensifying in Canada, with the highest number of doctor visits by children. But U.S. officials saw signs of a slowdown.

SOME DECLINES

&quot;We are beginning to see some declines in flu activity around the country but there is still a lot of influenza,&quot; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat told a news conference. [ID:nN20240316]

&quot;It is still much greater than we would normally see this time of year.&quot;

A team at flu test maker Quest Diagnostics (DGX.N) analyzed 142,000 U.S. flu tests and found a similar pattern, with tests showing a decline in flu-like illness since Oct. 27.

WHO said Norway and countries farther east including Georgia, Lithuania, Moldova and Serbia were reporting sharp increases in influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection.

Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and parts of Afghanistan -- particularly the capital, Kabul -- are reporting higher numbers of flu cases. Israel is also reporting sharp increases.

&quot;Essentially what is happening is that it is spreading eastward,&quot; Anthony Mounts of WHO&apos;s influenza team told Reuters. &quot;Typically, seasonal influenza always starts west and moves eastward. It seems to be following that pattern except it is coming very early this year.&quot;

Influenza can hit several peaks in a single season. Experts said weeks or months more of disease could be expected and noted that during the 1957 pandemic, a busy autumn was followed by a lull and then infections surged again starting in January.

Vaccination campaigns are beginning in many countries but companies reported some trouble making vaccine from the H1N1 virus. The United States was still struggling to distribute vaccines but Canadian Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said enough vaccine for almost half of Canada&apos;s population would have been shipped out by the end of the next week. [ID:nN20545281]

MUTANT VIRUSES

British health officials said they were investigating the likely person-to-person spread of a drug-resistant strain of swine flu. [ID:nLK669768]

The Health Protection Agency reported five confirmed cases in Wales of patients infected with H1N1 resistant Roche AG (ROG.VX) and Gilead Sciences Inc&apos;s (GILD.O) antiviral drug Tamiflu.

Another antiviral, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Biota Inc&apos;s (BTA.AX) Relenza, was effective in the patients, the HPA said.

The patients had serious conditions that suppressed their immune systems, which can give the virus a better than usual opportunity to develop resistance, the HPA added.

U.S. CDC officials also said they were investigating four cases of H1N1 resistant to Tamiflu at Duke University hospital in North Carolina. &quot;All four patients were very ill with underlying severely compromised immune systems and multiple other complex medical conditions,&quot; Duke said in a statement.

Health experts are looking for any sign that H1N1 is mutating into a drug-resistant form. Last year, the seasonal version of H1N1, a distant cousin of the pandemic strain, developed resistance to Tamiflu.

In Norway, officials were investigating a mutated strain in some patients that they said could be responsible for causing severe symptoms. [ID:nLK712029]

&quot;The mutation could be affecting the virus&apos; ability to go deeper into the respiratory system, thus causing more serious illness,&quot; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement.

WHO said the mutation did not appear to be widespread in Norway and the virus remained sensitive to antivirals and pandemic vaccines.

A similar mutation had been detected in H1N1 viruses in several other countries, including China and the United States, in severe as well as in some mild cases, it said.

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The pandemic of swine flu may be hitting a peak in the United States, health experts said on Friday.

But they stressed that influenza, especially a pandemic, could hit several peaks in a single season. They said weeks or months more of disease could be expected.

&quot;We are beginning to see some declines in flu activity around the country but there is still a lot of influenza,&quot; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat told a news conference.

&quot;It is still much greater than we would normally see this time of year.&quot;

Separately, a team at Quest Diagnostics (DGX.N) analyzed 142,000 flu tests and found a similar pattern, with tests showing a decline in flu-like illness since Oct. 27.

&quot;The number of specimens that tested positive for 2009 H1N1 influenza dropped in all age groups since late October, with the exception of those 65 years of age and older,&quot; the company said in a statement.

&quot;Our data provides encouraging signs that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus isn&apos;t spreading as aggressively now as it did in September and most of October,&quot; Quest&apos;s Dr. Jay Lieberman said in a statement.

&quot;This is encouraging but it doesn&apos;t mean that they still shouldn&apos;t be concerned about influenza. It&apos;s not over,&quot; Lieberman added in a telephone interview.

&quot;There can be multiple ups and downs over the season. We have many weeks ahead of us where disease is going to be circulating,&quot; Schuchat said.

KISSES AND VIRUSES

The U.S. holiday travel season is about to start, with millions expected to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday next Thursday -- a time when many Americans visit family -- and December holidays after that.

&quot;Some people say, well, all the kids get together with their grandparents and that&apos;s a lot of exchange of warmth and love, but a little exchange of viruses, too,&quot; Schuchat said.

CDC estimates at least 22 million Americans have been infected with H1N1, with 3,900 deaths.

In the past week, 21 U.S. children have died from H1N1, bringing the total of pediatric deaths in the pandemic to 171. Schuchat noted those were just confirmed cases -- CDC estimates more than 500 children have died since April.

She said CDC was still struggling to get vaccines up to desired levels. More than 54 million doses have been ordered or are available to order.

The original hope had been to have 20 million doses a week rolling out by now, but only 11 million doses were produced, packaged and shipped in the past week.

CDC officials also said they were investigating four cases of H1N1 resistant to Roche AG&apos;s (ROG.VX) antiviral drug Tamiflu at Duke University hospital in North Carolina. &quot;All four patients were very ill with underlying severely compromised immune systems and multiple other complex medical conditions,&quot; Duke said in a statement.

Health experts are looking for any sign that H1N1 is mutating into a drug-resistant form. Last year, the seasonal version of H1N1, a distant cousin of the pandemic strain, developed resistance to Tamiflu, the main drug used to treat flu, but GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) rival inhaled drug Relenza still worked well.

British health experts are investigating a similar cluster of Tamiflu resistance, also among severely ill patients. [ID:nLK440536] (Editing by Peter Cooney)</body>

She said CDC was still struggling to get vaccines up to desired levels. More than 54 million doses have been ordered or are available to order.

The original hope had been to have 20 million doses a week rolling out by now, but only 11 million doses were produced, packaged and shipped in the past week.

CDC officials also said they were investigating four cases of H1N1 resistant to Roche AG&apos;s antiviral drug Tamiflu at Duke University hospital in North Carolina. &quot;All four patients were very ill with underlying severely compromised immune systems and multiple other complex medical conditions,&quot; Duke said in a statement.

Health experts are looking for any sign that H1N1 is mutating into a drug-resistant form. Last year, the seasonal version of H1N1, a distant cousin of the pandemic strain, developed resistance to Tamiflu, the main drug used to treat flu, but GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s rival inhaled drug Relenza still worked well.

British health experts are investigating a similar cluster of Tamiflu resistance, also among severely ill patients.

* Five H1N1 patients resistant to Tamiflu

* Possible person-to-person spread of resistant strain

LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - British health officials are investigating the likely person-to-person spread of a drug-resistant strain of swine flu, the Health Protection Agency said on Friday.

There have been five confirmed cases in Wales of patients infected with H1N1 resistant to oseltamivir -- the generic name of Roche AG (ROG.VX) and Gilead Sciences Inc&apos;s (GILD.O) antiviral drug Tamiflu, the agency said.

Four other patients are infected with H1N1 with the same genetic mutation but one was helped by Tamiflu and the status of three others is not clear. Another antiviral, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Biota Inc&apos;s (BTA.AX) Relenza, was effective in the patients, the HPA said.

The patients had serious conditions that suppressed their immune systems, which can give the virus a better than usual opportunity to develop resistance, the HPA added.

&quot;Although further epidemiological investigation is underway, it would seem likely that transmission of oseltamivir-resitant H1N1 virus has taken place,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;At present we believe the risk to the general healthy population is low.&quot;

John McCauley of the Medical Research Council said the patients involved were in an at-risk group.

&quot;It is well established that patients with immunodeficiency do have problems with eliminating virus, giving it a greater chance to acquire resistance,&quot; he said in a statement.

The World Health Organisation has reported 57 cases of Tamiflu resistance worldwide. There have not yet been any confirmed cases of person-to-person transmission, although a possible case in the United States is under investigation.

The British government launched a national pandemic flu service in July to allow people to get a diagnosis and prescription online or over the phone without visiting a doctor.

It said on Friday it was taking the development of a Tamiflu-resistant strain seriously but it would continue to offer the antiviral to all patients.

&quot;Our strategy to offer antivirals to all patients with swine flu is the right one, to help prevent complications and reduce the severity of the illness,&quot; the Department of Health said in a statement.

British officials have confirmed the H1N1 virus has killed 214 people, but experts note that most people who are made sick by the virus are not tested.

A nationwide vaccination programme began last month, initially targeting those considered high risk, such as pregnant women and front-line healthcare workers.

Norwegian health authorities reported a mutation of H1N1 in some patients with severe disease but other officials noted quickly that other patients infected with the same mutant have had mild disease. [ID:nLK669768] (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; editing by David Stamp)</body>

    <body>BEIJING, Nov 20 (Reuters) - China has promised severe punishment for officials caught concealing deaths from H1N1 flu after a medical expert said suspect cases may have been held back by local governments.

The Health Ministry said China had adopted a new H1N1 accounting method earlier this month. If a person was confirmed with H1N1 and then died, the case should be reported as death from H1N1, whether or not there was another condition.

&quot;People responsible will be punished if reports of H1N1 virus cases are held back, lied about or delayed,&quot; said Deng Haihua, spokesman for China&apos;s Health Ministry, according to a notice on the ministry&apos;s website (www.moh.gov.cn) seen on Friday.

Zhong Nanshan, respected by many in China for his candour and work fighting &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; (SARS) in 2003, said he did not believe that the national H1N1 death toll of 53, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported on Thursday.

Zhong, who is now a doctor based in southern province of Guangdong, said that &quot;some areas have not been testing deaths from severe (pneumonia) and treating them as cases of ordinary pneumonia without any question&quot;.

The H1N1 flu strain affects the respiratory tract. Patients who become severely ill or die typically suffer from pneumonia, either brought on directly by the virus or due to secondary bacterial infections.

The previous method attributed the death to previously existing conditions but not to H1N1, thereby reducing the number of cases reported as H1N1 death cases, a separate notice on the Health Ministry&apos;s website said.

A ministry official told Reuters it would no longer issue cumulative tolls, only new cases and deaths.

That will make it difficult to determine the actual extent of H1N1 deaths in China, which based on previous figures had been statistically much lower than in other countries. (Reporting by Huang Yan and Lucy Hornby)</body>

    <body>By Stephanie Nebehay

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization said on Thursday the H1N1 vaccine had been cleared of blame for 41 deaths which health authorities worldwide had investigated after suspicions they might have been caused by the inoculation.

The U.N. agency reaffirmed that the pandemic vaccine is as safe as the seasonal flu vaccine used for more than 60 years. It also voiced concern that some pregnant women and others at risk were shunning it because of a fear of side-effects.

&quot;No new safety issue has been identified from reports issued to date ... Reporting so far reconfirms that the pandemic flu vaccine is as safe as the seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO&apos;s top vaccine expert, told a telephone conference.

Governments have so far reported that 65 million vaccine doses have been administered against H1N1, known as swine flu, in 16 countries, but the true figure is probably higher since immunization campaigns are under way in 40 countries, she said.

Side-effects commonly reported include swelling and redness or pain at the injection site, although some had fever or headache, and all symptoms usually disappear after 48 hours.

A &quot;small number of deaths&quot; had been reported, she said, and a WHO spokeswoman later put the figure at 41 in six countries.

&quot;Although some investigations are still ongoing, the results of the completed investigations reported to WHO have ruled out that the pandemic vaccine is the cause of death,&quot; Kieny said.

Authorities in China -- where 11 million people have been vaccinated -- have reported 2 deaths following inoculation and 15 cases of severe side effects, the WHO said in a statement.

&quot;Thorough investigation of these deaths, including a review of autopsy results, determined that underlying medical conditions were the cause of death and not the vaccine,&quot; it said of China.

Fewer than a dozen suspected cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome had been reported following pandemic vaccination, she said. &quot;Only a few of this Guillain-Barre may be linked to the pandemic vaccine .... and patients have recovered,&quot; she added.

&quot;NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE&quot;

GlaxoSmithKline Plc, AstraZeneca Plc, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis are among about 25 manufacturers producing H1N1 vaccine using different techniques.

&quot;No significant difference in the safety profile between different types of vaccine has been detected,&quot; Kieny said.

She denounced conspiracy theories about vaccines circulating on the Internet, saying they were causing &quot;artificial worries.&quot;

&quot;We have to reiterate that the vaccines are safe, that the disease in certain people can be severe and can be cause of death,&quot; she said.

The H1N1 virus is known to have killed 6,250 people worldwide since emerging in North America last April, according to the WHO.

A survey of doctors showed on Wednesday that more than half of Britons being offered vaccination against H1N1 were turning it down because they feared side-effects or believed the virus was too mild to bother about.

&quot;It is worrying indeed that certain groups don&apos;t seem to be coming readily to be vaccinated. But we hope that the data ... on the safety of these vaccines will dissipate the worries that a population might have and will help convince them that the vaccine is safe and vaccination will protect them against this disease which can be severe,&quot; Kieny said.

    <body>BEIJING (Reuters) - China may have had more H1N1 flu deaths than have been reported, with some local governments possibly concealing suspect cases, a prominent Chinese medical expert said in an interview published on Thursday.

Zhong Nanshan, a doctor based in the far southern province of Guangdong, said he doubted the current official death toll from the influenza strain, also called &quot;swine flu,&quot; that has medical experts worldwide worried.

&quot;I just don&apos;t believe that nationwide there have been in all 53 H1N1 deaths,&quot; Zhong told the Southern Metropolis Daily, a popular Guangdong newspaper.

Zhong said that &quot;some areas have not been testing deaths from severe (pneumonia) and treating them as cases of ordinary pneumonia without a question,&quot; the paper reported.

Zhong is respected by many people in China for his candor and work in fighting &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; (SARS) in 2003, when nationwide panic and international alarm erupted after it emerged that officials hid or underplayed the spreading epidemic.

China, the world&apos;s most populous country, has reported 28 new H1N1 deaths in the last week during a cold snap across much of the country, the Ministry of Health said on its website (www.moh.gov.cn).

The latest national death tally issued on Monday on the same website showed 53 death cases.

The H1N1 flu strain affects the respiratory tract and patients who become severely ill or die typically suffer from pneumonia which is brought on either directly by the virus or due to secondary bacterial infections owing to the person&apos;s weakened immune system.

&quot;It&apos;s irresponsible to treat these cases as ordinary pneumonia deaths,&quot; Zhong said of untested deaths, according to the paper.

Zhong said his home Guangdong province was acting responsibly, but the report did not say which areas he had doubts about.

Cover-ups by local governments in 2003 during the SARS epidemic led to the sackings of several officials. More than 300 people died in that outbreak.

The Health Ministry did not have immediate comments on Zhong&apos;s remarks.

Zhong said China&apos;s peak flu season will start in December and last until February next year in the north of the country, a time when Chinese gather for the traditional Lunar New Year.

China is preparing for possible wider outbreaks. More than 34.8 million people have received free vaccination until Wednesday, the ministry said.

    <body>MALE, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Maldivian health authorities on Thursday confirmed the Indian Ocean archipelago&apos;s first death from the H1N1 flu virus.

A 65-year Maldivian man with no recent history of travel abroad died on Wednesday, the first death reported from the flu, Ahmed Jamsheed Mohamed, senior medical officer at the Centre for Community Health and Disease, told Reuters.

Four local and two foreigners have already tested positive for the flu, since detected first on July 25.

&quot;All six cases that we have previously reported were imported. This is the first case of local transmission. We realise the virus is circulating in the Maldives,&quot; said Jamsheed.

All six had already recovered, he said.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

BETHESDA, Maryland, Nov 19 (Reuters) - More safety data would be needed before a new type of influenza vaccine made in insect cells should get approval, federal advisers said on Thursday.

A divided committee advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the new Protein Sciences Corp FluBlok vaccine appears effective among adults under age 50 but said the company has not shown that it is safe enough to be approved.

The vaccine is made using genetically engineered pieces of flu virus inserted into caterpillar cells, instead of the current method using whole virus grown in chicken eggs.

The U.S. government is struggling to vaccinate the population against H1N1, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates has infected 22 million Americans and killed 3,900 since April.

Fewer than 50 million doses of H1N1 vaccine are now available.

Some panel members were concerned about some side-effects seen in people who volunteered to test it, such as a woman who had Bell&apos;s palsy, a temporary paralysis of the face, that flared up an hour after she was vaccinated.

&quot;I don&apos;t feel the safety database is large enough,&quot; said Pamela McInnes of the National Institutes of Health. She said the vaccine is a new formulation and so the burden of proof is higher than simply changing the influenza strain from one season to another.

&quot;I feel the safety data do not raise significant red flags,&quot; disagreed Dr. Jack Stapleton of the University of Iowa.

&quot;What we are dealing with, rock bottom, is a pretty mediocre vaccine,&apos; said Dr. Theodore Eickhoff, a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a panel member.

The vaccine is made using cells from a caterpillar and would be the first influenza vaccine made using cell cultures approved in the United States.

The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its advisory committees.

The company says it could produce a vaccine much more quickly than traditional egg-based techniques -- in two months, versus five to six months for vaccines made using eggs.

The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee said the data show the vaccine works well enough in adults aged up to 50, but six of 11 members said studies do not show the vaccine works safely.

Connecticut-based Protein Sciences, a closely held biotech, won a $35 million federal contract in June to make vaccines for pandemic influenza. The contract could be expanded over five years for a total of nearly $150 million.

By Stephanie Nebehay

GENEVA, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation said on Thursday the H1N1 vaccine had been cleared of blame for 41 deaths which health authorities worldwide had investigated after suspicions they might have been caused by the inoculation.

The U.N. agency reaffirmed that the pandemic vaccine is as safe as the seasonal flu vaccine used for more than 60 years. It also voiced concern that some pregnant women and others at risk were shunning it because of a fear of side-effects.

&quot;No new safety issue has been identified from reports issued to date ... Reporting so far reconfirms that the pandemic flu vaccine is as safe as the seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO&apos;s top vaccine expert, told a telephone conference.

Governments have so far reported that 65 million vaccine doses have been administered against H1N1, known as swine flu, in 16 countries, but the true figure is probably higher since immunisation campaigns are under way in 40 countries, she said.

Side-effects commonly reported include swelling and redness or pain at the injection site, although some had fever or headache, and all symptoms usually disappear after 48 hours.

A &quot;small number of deaths&quot; had been reported, she said, and a WHO spokeswoman later put the figure at 41 in six countries.

&quot;Although some investigations are still ongoing, the results of the completed investigations reported to WHO have ruled out that the pandemic vaccine is the cause of death,&quot; Kieny said.

Authorities in China -- where 11 million people have been vaccinated -- have reported 2 deaths following inoculation and 15 cases of severe side effects, the WHO said in a statement.

&quot;Thorough investigation of these deaths, including a review of autopsy results, determined that underlying medical conditions were the cause of death and not the vaccine,&quot; it said of China.

Fewer than a dozen suspected cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome had been reported following pandemic vaccination, she said. &quot;Only a few of this Guillain-Barre may be linked to the pandemic vaccine .... and patients have recovered,&quot; she added.

&quot;NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE&quot;

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) Plc, AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), Novartis (NOVN.VX) and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among about 25 manufacturers producing H1N1 vaccine using different techniques.

&quot;No significant difference in the safety profile between different types of vaccine has been detected,&quot; Kieny said.

She denounced conspiracy theories about vaccines circulating on the Internet, saying they were causing &quot;artificial worries&quot;.

&quot;We have to reiterate that the vaccines are safe, that the disease in certain people can be severe and can be cause of death,&quot; she said.

The H1N1 virus is known to have killed 6,250 people worldwide since emerging in North America last April, according to the WHO.

A survey of doctors showed on Wednesday that more than half of Britons being offered vaccination against H1N1 were turning it down because they feared side-effects or believed the virus was too mild to bother about. [ID:nL110510]

&quot;It is worrying indeed that certain groups don&apos;t seem to be coming readily to be vaccinated. But we hope that the data ... on the safety of these vaccines will dissipate the worries that a population might have and will help convince them that the vaccine is safe and vaccination will protect them against this disease which can be severe,&quot; Kieny said.

    <body>BEIJING (Reuters) - China may have had more H1N1 flu deaths than have been reported, with some local governments possibly concealing suspect cases, a prominent Chinese medical expert said in an interview published on Thursday.

Zhong Nanshan, a doctor based in the far southern province of Guangdong, said he doubted the current official death toll from the influenza strain, also called &quot;swine flu,&quot; that has medical experts worldwide worried.

&quot;I just don&apos;t believe that nationwide there have been in all 53 H1N1 deaths,&quot; Zhong told the Southern Metropolis Daily, a popular Guangdong newspaper.

Zhong said that &quot;some areas have not been testing deaths from severe (pneumonia) and treating them as cases of ordinary pneumonia without a question,&quot; the paper reported.

Zhong is respected by many people in China for his candor and work in fighting &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; (SARS) in 2003, when nationwide panic and international alarm erupted after it emerged that officials hid or underplayed the spreading epidemic.

China, the world&apos;s most populous country, has reported 28 new H1N1 deaths in the last week during a cold snap across much of the country, the Ministry of Health said on its website (www.moh.gov.cn).

The latest national death tally issued on Monday on the same website showed 53 death cases.

The H1N1 flu strain affects the respiratory tract and patients who become severely ill or die typically suffer from pneumonia which is brought on either directly by the virus or due to secondary bacterial infections owing to the person&apos;s weakened immune system.

&quot;It&apos;s irresponsible to treat these cases as ordinary pneumonia deaths,&quot; Zhong said of untested deaths, according to the paper.

Zhong said his home Guangdong province was acting responsibly, but the report did not say which areas he had doubts about.

Cover-ups by local governments in 2003 during the SARS epidemic led to the sackings of several officials. More than 300 people died in that outbreak.

The Health Ministry did not have immediate comments on Zhong&apos;s remarks.

Zhong said China&apos;s peak flu season will start in December and last until February next year in the north of the country, a time when Chinese gather for the traditional Lunar New Year.

China is preparing for possible wider outbreaks. More than 34.8 million people have received free vaccination until Wednesday, the ministry said.

BETHESDA, Maryland, Nov 19 (Reuters) - More safety data would be needed before a new type of influenza vaccine made in insect cells should get approval, federal advisers said on Thursday.

A divided committee advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the new Protein Sciences Corp FluBlok vaccine appears effective among adults under age 50 but said the company has not shown that it is safe enough to be approved.

The vaccine is made using genetically engineered pieces of flu virus inserted into caterpillar cells, instead of the current method of growing virus in chicken eggs. The company says it could produce a vaccine much more quickly -- in two months, versus five to six months for vaccines made using eggs.

&quot;This is a promising technology, and I think we need it,&quot; said Dr. Bruce Gellin, head of the Health and Human Services Department&apos;s National Vaccine Program Office and a member of the panel. He said companies making such new vaccines would be paying close attention to the panelists&apos; comments.

The U.S. government is struggling to vaccinate the population against H1N1, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates has infected 22 million Americans and killed 3,900 since April.

Fewer than 50 million doses of H1N1 vaccine are now available.

Some panel members were concerned about some side-effects seen in a few of the 3,200 people who volunteered to test it, such as a woman who had Bell&apos;s palsy, a temporary paralysis of the face, that flared up an hour after she was vaccinated.

They also worried that several people who volunteered to test the vaccine had been &quot;lost to follow-up&quot;, meaning the researchers had been unable to find out how they fared after being vaccinated.

&quot;I don&apos;t feel the safety database is large enough,&quot; said Pamela McInnes of the National Institutes of Health. She said the vaccine is a new formulation and so the burden of proof is higher than simply changing the influenza strain from one season to another.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vaccine makers praised the U.S. response to the swine flu pandemic on Wednesday but said regulatory delays and public suspicion have held up innovative ways to speed and stretch the U.S. influenza vaccine supply.

Pharmaceutical executives said their companies were working on ways to make flu vaccines more quickly and in greater quantities, but said regulatory approval was slow. They complained about U.S. reluctance to use additives called adjuvants that can boost a vaccine&apos;s effects.

The pandemic of H1N1 swine flu has infected 22 million Americans and killed 3,900, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some politicians have criticized the U.S. response but the executives and other experts defended the government at a joint hearing of House of Representatives subcommittees on health and oversight.

&quot;We have moved as fast as or faster than any other country in the world,&quot; said Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the non-profit Trust for America&apos;s Health, which has in the past criticized U.S. preparedness for pandemics.

&quot;Given the totality of circumstances, the successful development, clinical testing, and large scale production of an H1N1 vaccine in such a short amount of time, despite all the challenges and uncertainties that were overcome, was a significant accomplishment for the U.S. government and Novartis Vaccines partnership,&quot; added Dr Vas Narasimhan of Novartis.

But they also pointed to longstanding roadblocks to moving beyond old technology that relies on chicken eggs to more reliable biotechnology methods that use cells.

&quot;In the current environment, the hurdles to bringing forward innovative products like cell culture-produced live, attenuated influenza vaccines are likely to take many years and cost a great deal,&quot; said Ben Machielse of AstraZeneca unit MedImmune.

&quot;Manufacturers urgently need a way to discuss end-to-end product development plans with the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) or its advisory boards early in the product development process,&quot; Machielse said.

FDA&apos;s Dr Jesse Goodman said the agency was sticking with &quot;tried and true&quot; technology and Levi said officials had little choice, given the U.S. public&apos;s mistrust of new vaccines.

MedImmune has not had the problems with making vaccines that other manufacturers did and has more vaccine than it can package in the approved nose sprayers. The company and FDA been discussing using nose droppers as an alternative.

DELAYS AND RULES

&quot;We proposed an aggressive schedule to deliver 30 to 50 million more doses in October,&quot; Machielse said in written testimony. But he said the Health and Human Services Department delayed consideration when it was learned that a single dose of H1N1 vaccine would protect adults and older children.

Phil Hosbach of Sanofi Pasteur Inc said HHS ordered more pre-filled syringes and fewer multi-dose vials of vaccine than the company had anticipated, forcing time-consuming changes.

Another problem -- Americans do not seek flu vaccines in general. Only 107 million got seasonal flu vaccines in 2007, said Narasimhan.

&quot;U.S. seasonal influenza manufacturing at 2008/2009 pricing levels was not profitable,&quot; Narasimhan said.

&quot;This situation, combined with ever-increasing regulatory requirements and additional data requirements for the licensure of new and improved influenza vaccine products, means that many improvements ... are not being pursued.&quot;

For instance, adding adjuvants would help by allowing lower doses of vaccine and potentially offering cross-protection against mutated versions of flu viruses, Narasimhan said.

But he said there was no &quot;clear regulatory pathway&quot; for adjuvants in the United States, although they are widely used in Europe. And Levi noted that Americans are afraid of new ingredients such as adjuvants.

An estimated 159 million Americans such as pregnant women and healthcare workers have priority for vaccine, and surveys suggest about half would seek one.

HHS had hoped to have vaccinated most of these people by the first week of December but the CDC&apos;s Dr Anne Schuchat said 49 million doses had been delivered as of Wednesday.

The U.S. government is struggling to vaccinate the population against H1N1, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates has infected 22 million Americans and killed 3,900 since April.

Fewer than 50 million doses of H1N1 vaccine are now available.

Some panel members were concerned about some side-effects seen in people who volunteered to test it, such as a woman who had Bell&apos;s palsy, a temporary paralysis of the face, that flared up an hour after she was vaccinated.

&quot;I don&apos;t feel the safety database is large enough,&quot; said Pamela McInnes of the National Institutes of Health. She said the vaccine is a new formulation and so the burden of proof is higher than simply changing the influenza strain from one season to another.

&quot;I feel the safety data do not raise significant red flags,&quot; disagreed Dr. Jack Stapleton of the University of Iowa.

&quot;What we are dealing with, rock bottom, is a pretty mediocre vaccine,&apos; said Dr. Theodore Eickhoff, a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a panel member.

The vaccine is made using cells from a caterpillar and would be the first influenza vaccine made using cell cultures approved in the United States.

The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its advisory committees.

The company says it could produce a vaccine much more quickly than traditional egg-based techniques -- in two months, versus five to six months for vaccines made using eggs.

The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee said the data show the vaccine works well enough in adults aged up to 50, but six of 11 members said studies do not show the vaccine works safely.

Connecticut-based Protein Sciences, a closely held biotech, won a $35 million federal contract in June to make vaccines for pandemic influenza. The contract could be expanded over five years for a total of nearly $150 million.

Protein Sciences tested a formulation for seasonal influenza vaccine, but it could easily be changed to cover pandemic H1N1 swine flu.

    <body>BEIJING, Nov 19 (Reuters) - China may have had more H1N1 flu deaths than have been reported, with some local governments possibly concealing suspect cases, a prominent Chinese medical expert said in an interview published on Thursday.

Zhong Nanshan, a doctor based in the far southern province of Guangdong, said he doubted the current official death toll from the influenza strain, also called &quot;swine flu&quot;, that has medical experts worldwide worried.

&quot;I just don&apos;t believe that nationwide there have been in all 53 H1N1 deaths,&quot; Zhong told the Southern Metropolis Daily, a popular Guangdong newspaper.

Zhong said that &quot;some areas have not been testing deaths from severe (pneumonia) and treating them as cases of ordinary pneumonia without a question,&quot; the paper reported.

Zhong is respected by many people in China for his candour and work in fighting &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; (SARS) in 2003, when nationwide panic and international alarm erupted after it emerged that officials hid or underplayed the spreading epidemic.

China, the world&apos;s most populous country, has reported 28 new H1N1 deaths in the last week during a cold snap across much of the country, the Ministry of Health said on its website (www.moh.gov.cn).

The latest national death tally issued on Monday on the same website showed 53 death cases.

The H1N1 flu strain affects the respiratory tract and patients who become severely ill or die typically suffer from pneumonia which is brought on either directly by the virus or due to secondary bacterial infections owing to the person&apos;s weakened immune system.

&quot;It&apos;s irresponsible to treat these cases as ordinary pneumonia deaths,&quot; Zhong said of untested deaths, according to the paper.

Zhong said his home Guangdong province was acting responsibly, but the report did not say which areas he had doubts about.

Cover-ups by local governments in 2003 during the SARS epidemic led to the sackings of several officials. More than 300 people died in that outbreak.

The Health Ministry did not have immediate comments on Zhong&apos;s remarks.

Zhong said China&apos;s peak flu season will start in December and last until February next year in the north of the country, a time when Chinese gather for the traditional Lunar New Year.

China is preparing for possible wider outbreaks. More than 34.8 million people have received free vaccination until Wednesday, the ministry said. (Reporting by Huang Yan and Chris Buckley; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)</body>

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - More than half of Britons being offered vaccination against pandemic H1N1 flu are turning it down because they fear side-effects or think the virus is too mild to bother, a survey of doctors showed on Wednesday.

Many of the 107 family doctors polled by Britain&apos;s Pulse magazine said there was widespread resistance from patients and on average only 46 percent of those offered the vaccination agree to have it.

Doctors reported particular difficulties in persuading pregnant women to be vaccinated against the virus, according to Pulse, a trade newspaper for doctors.

&quot;In all the pregnant women we&apos;ve offered it to, I think only about one in 20 has agreed,&quot; Dr Chris Udenze, a family doctor based in Nottingham, central England, said in the survey.

Scepticism has been growing in Britain and other European countries about health authorities&apos; handling of the H1N1 pandemic because the number of people infected has been lower than originally feared.

Britain began a vaccination programme on Oct. 21 for high-risk hospital patients, front-line healthcare workers, children in seasonal flu risk groups, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.

British health authorities have twice revised down their worst-case scenarios for H1N1 flu, which was declared a pandemic in June and has killed more than 7,000 people worldwide, according to latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Original estimates that as many as 65,000 could die from H1N1 in Britain have now been cut to a prediction of around 1,000 deaths -- way below the average annual toll of 4,000 to 8,000 deaths from seasonal winter flu.

Richard Hoey, Pulse&apos;s editor, said his survey showed that many patients, and a substantial number of doctors were &quot;unconvinced there is sufficient evidence that swine flu vaccination is safe and necessary&quot;.

A spokesman for the government&apos;s health department said it was &quot;too early to speculate on uptake rates&quot; for H1N1 vaccines but that doctors were working hard to reach as many patients as possible with their initial supplies.

&quot;We recommend that people in the at risk groups accept the offer of vaccination,&quot; he said. &quot;People in the risk groups are more likely to be severely ill if they catch swine flu, and the vaccine provides the best protection against the disease.&quot; (Editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)</body>

* Test kits use 3M platform

By Deena Beasley

LOS ANGELES, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Quest Diagnostics Inc&apos;s (DGX.N) molecular test for identifying patients infected with the H1N1 flu virus has been approved by European regulators and is available for distribution to some 35 countries, the medical testing provider said on Tuesday.

The test, which has been given the brand name Simplexa, has been available under an emergency authorization in the United States for several months, but Quest said its second-generation version of the platform is in the process of being rolled out.

The virus, commonly referred to as swine flu, is a subtype of Influenza virus Type A. The Quest test can detect the presence of 2009 H1N1 influenza RNA in a patient&apos;s nasal or nasopharyngeal specimen.

With earlier versions of the test, healthcare providers had to acquire the specimen and send it in to a Quest laboratory. &quot;That takes time -- 24 to 48 hours,&quot; said Dr. Jay Lieberman, medical Director for infectious diseases at Quest. &quot;This new instrument increases the capacity of other hospital laboratories and regional laboratories to get results within hours.&quot;

Quest said the Simplexa test is an outgrowth of an exclusive global distribution agreement between its infectious disease diagnostic unit and 3M Co (MMM.N). Quest will develop and offer molecular diagnostic test kits on a 3M platform.

The compact unit can process up to 96 samples per run, and provides results in 30 to 85 minutes, depending on the test&apos;s parameters.

Quest said in a recent report that between the launch of its H1N1 test in early May and mid-October, it had performed about 76,500 of the tests in the United States.

The company said its pricing strategy will vary based on individual country and regional factors. In the United States, the price is about $50 per test, although a lab would need to incur other costs not included in the test kit, such as sample preparation and other supplies, The 3M platform is priced below $75,000.

Lieberman said that last year about 20 percent of Quest&apos;s revenue was derived from &quot;esoteric&quot; tests like the H1N1 kit, up from 9 percent in 2000.

Quest said it plans to launch additional Simplexa test kits on the 3M platform for other infectious diseases in 2010, pending required regulatory clearances.</body>

    <body>* Regulatory processes hold up innovation, companies say

* Observers agree U.S. has moved quickly to fight flu

* CDC says 49 million doses now delivered

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Vaccine makers praised the U.S. response to the swine flu pandemic on Wednesday but said regulatory delays and public suspicion have held up innovative ways to speed and stretch the U.S. influenza vaccine supply.

Pharmaceutical executives said their companies were working on ways to make flu vaccines more quickly and in greater quantities, but said regulatory approval was slow. They complained about U.S. reluctance to use additives called adjuvants that can boost a vaccine&apos;s effects.

The pandemic of H1N1 swine flu has infected 22 million Americans and killed 3,900, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some politicians have criticized the U.S. response but the executives and other experts defended the government at a joint hearing of House of Representatives subcommittees on health and oversight.

&quot;We have moved as fast as or faster than any other country in the world,&quot; said Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the non-profit Trust for America&apos;s Health, which has in the past criticized U.S. preparedness for pandemics.

&quot;Given the totality of circumstances, the successful development, clinical testing, and large scale production of an H1N1 vaccine in such a short amount of time, despite all the challenges and uncertainties that were overcome, was a significant accomplishment for the U.S. government and Novartis Vaccines partnership,&quot; added Dr Vas Narasimhan of Novartis (NOVN.VX).

But they also pointed to longstanding roadblocks to moving beyond old technology that relies on chicken eggs to more reliable biotechnology methods that use cells.

&quot;In the current environment, the hurdles to bringing forward innovative products like cell culture-produced live, attenuated influenza vaccines are likely to take many years and cost a great deal,&quot; said Ben Machielse of AstraZeneca (AZN.N) unit MedImmune.

&quot;Manufacturers urgently need a way to discuss end-to-end product development plans with the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) or its advisory boards early in the product development process,&quot; Machielse said.

FDA&apos;s Dr Jesse Goodman said the agency was sticking with &quot;tried and true&quot; technology and Levi said officials had little choice, given the U.S. public&apos;s mistrust of new vaccines.

MedImmune has not had the problems with making vaccines that other manufacturers did and has more vaccine than it can package in the approved nose sprayers. The company and FDA been discussing using nose droppers as an alternative.

DELAYS AND RULES

&quot;We proposed an aggressive schedule to deliver 30 to 50 million more doses in October,&quot; Machielse said in written testimony. But he said the Health and Human Services Department delayed consideration when it was learned that a single dose of H1N1 vaccine would protect adults and older children.

Phil Hosbach of Sanofi Pasteur Inc (SASY.PA) said HHS ordered more pre-filled syringes and fewer multi-dose vials of vaccine than the company had anticipated, forcing time-consuming changes.

Another problem -- Americans do not seek flu vaccines in general. Only 107 million got seasonal flu vaccines in 2007, said Narasimhan.

&quot;U.S. seasonal influenza manufacturing at 2008/2009 pricing levels was not profitable,&quot; Narasimhan said.

&quot;This situation, combined with ever-increasing regulatory requirements and additional data requirements for the licensure of new and improved influenza vaccine products, means that many improvements ... are not being pursued.&quot;

For instance, adding adjuvants would help by allowing lower doses of vaccine and potentially offering cross-protection against mutated versions of flu viruses, Narasimhan said.

But he said there was no &quot;clear regulatory pathway&quot; for adjuvants in the United States, although they are widely used in Europe. And Levi noted that Americans are afraid of new ingredients such as adjuvants.

An estimated 159 million Americans such as pregnant women and healthcare workers have priority for vaccine, and surveys suggest about half would seek one.

HHS had hoped to have vaccinated most of these people by the first week of December but the CDC&apos;s Dr Anne Schuchat said 49 million doses had been delivered as of Wednesday.

    <body>MOSCOW, Nov 18 (Reuters Life!) - Russia&apos;s top health official has proposed that the country&apos;s fashion designers create trendy face masks to combat swine flu, his spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

Telling health experts in the west Siberian city of Tomsk on Tuesday, Gennady Onishchenko said: &quot;They could design them as clothing... it would be absolutely amazing!&quot;

More than 5,600 cases of H1N1, or swine flu, have been confirmed in Russia, while local media reports say 26 people have died from the virus.

Onishchenko said flamboyant designer Slava Zaitsev, known for his deep reds and blues on traditional Russian patterns, or Valentin Yudashkin, who dresses the nation&apos;s military, could be fit for the job.

    <body>MOSCOW (Reuters Life!) - Russia&apos;s top health official has proposed that the country&apos;s fashion designers create trendy face masks to combat swine flu, his spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

Telling health experts in the west Siberian city of Tomsk on Tuesday, Gennady Onishchenko said: &quot;They could design them as clothing... it would be absolutely amazing!&quot;

More than 5,600 cases of H1N1, or swine flu, have been confirmed in Russia, while local media reports say 26 people have died from the virus.

Onishchenko said flamboyant designer Slava Zaitsev, known for his deep reds and blues on traditional Russian patterns, or Valentin Yudashkin, who dresses the nation&apos;s military, could be fit for the job.

BUENOS AIRES, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Argentina&apos;s tax revenue could return to double-digit growth in November, the head of the country&apos;s tax agency said on Wednesday.

Higher tourist volume and a pick-up in international trade will contribute to the increase, Ricardo Echegaray, the head of AFIP agency, told reporters in Buenos Aires.

&quot;Tourist buses are full and one has to see all the movement with containers at the Buenos Aires port,&quot; Echegaray said.

Argentina&apos;s October tax take rose a higher-than-expected 8.8 percent from a year earlier to 26.42 billion pesos ($6.94 billion).

Still, tax revenue growth has slowed in the past couple of months, affected in part by a severe outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus, that kept many Argentines away from shopping centers and tourist areas.

&quot;We&apos;ve suffered the impact of two crises ... with the global economic slowdown and with the flu,&quot; Echegaray added. &quot; (But) there has been a clear rebound in revenue last month.&quot;

The government is expected to release figures for November in early December.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People who have had repeated flu infections -- or repeated flu vaccines -- may have some protection against the new pandemic swine influenza, U.S. researchers said on Monday.

They found evidence that the human immune system can recognize bits of the new H1N1 virus that are similar to older, distantly related H1N1 strains.

&quot;What we have found is that the swine flu has similarities to the seasonal flu, which appear to provide some level of pre-existing immunity. This suggests that it could make the disease less severe in the general population than originally feared,&quot; said Alessandro Sette, director of the Center for Infectious Disease at California&apos;s La Jolla Institute.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may also help explain why many older people are less likely to have severe disease, said Allison Deckhut-Augustine of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

&quot;Adults may have some pre-existing immunity for H1N1,&quot; Deckhut-Augustine said in a telephone interview.

That does not mean older people are protected from infection, and Deckhut-Augustine stressed that people should still be vaccinated against H1N1.

Swine flu has infected millions of people globally and killed an estimated 3,900 in the United States alone, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drug makers are struggling to make vaccines and governments are working to vaccinate their populations.

Bjoern Peters and colleagues at the La Jolla Institute looked at flu epitopes -- molecular markers or structures that the immune system recognizes -- dating back 20 years.

&quot;We found that the immune system&apos;s T-cells can recognize a significant percent of the markers in swine flu,&quot; Peters said in a statement.

DUAL PROTECTION

The human immune system has two kinds of protection. Antibody response can prevent infection, while T-cells fight infection once it has occurred.

Peters and colleagues found T-cell protection but not antibody response.

&quot;This T-cell response decreases severity of disease but doesn&apos;t prevent infection,&quot; said Deckhut-Augustine, whose agency helped pay for the study and maintains the public database that Peters used.

The effect could be cumulative, Peters said, which could explain why people over 50 seem to be less likely to get noticeable H1N1 infections.

&quot;This may also suggest why children are more susceptible to severe infection and why they might need two boosts,&quot; Deckhut-Augustine said. &quot;They haven&apos;t been around as long and they haven&apos;t been exposed to different strains of H1N1 as long as adults.&quot;

Influenza is a very mutation-prone virus and from year to year the circulating strains drift, or change slightly. This is why new vaccines must be formulated each year and why people can catch flu again and again.

The new H1N1 was a never-before-seen combination of swine flu viruses, with a sprinkling of human and avian flu virus genetic sequences. But its long-ago ancestor was an H1N1 virus first seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed upwards of 50 million people.

The researchers found that the new H1N1 swine flu shared 49 percent of its epitopes with older, seasonal H1N1 strains.

Using blood from healthy donors, they found that T-cells could recognize about 17 percent of these markers.

    <body>ZURICH, Nov 17 (Reuters) - A U.S. clinical study suggests that just half a dose of the Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) H1N1 vaccine may be enough to generate a protective immune response, the Swiss drugmaker said on Tuesday.

Novartis said data from about 4,000 individuals suggested that half a dose of its U.S.-approved unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine met immune criteria in adults and the elderly.

The data also showed that its adjuvant was well tolerated, which could potentially quadruple the Novartis vaccine supply. (Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Catherine Bosley)</body>

    <body>* 37 died of flu in Canada during past week

* One-fifth of population vaccinated

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The H1N1 flu killed more people in Canada during the past week than in any other week this year, but health officials said on Tuesday the nation&apos;s vaccination program was going so well that it may reach its peak earlier than expected.

Thirty-seven people died of the pandemic flu Nov. 12-17, bringing Canada&apos;s death toll from H1N1 to 198, out of a population of 34 million. Comparable figures from other weeks were not available.

&quot;Rather than seeing thousands of deaths we&apos;ve been fortunate to have people doing what they need to do (to avoid the flu),&quot; Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, told reporters in Ottawa. &quot;I think we&apos;re in a relatively good position, but a pandemic is always full of surprises.&quot;

Health officials had expected the flu to peak sometime in December, but Butler-Jones said the vaccination program&apos;s progress may move the peak earlier.

About 20 percent of Canadians have now been immunized, Butler-Jones said, the same estimate that health officials gave late last week.

That makes Canada a global leader in terms of the percentage of the population that has received the vaccine, said Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.

By the end of this week, the federal government will have delivered 10 million doses of the vaccine to the country&apos;s 13 provinces and territories, she said.

The vaccine, produced by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), is currently available only for high-risk groups, such as children, pregnant women and those with a chronic medical condition.

All Canadians who want to get the vaccine are expected to have received it by the end of December.

Health officials reported 36 serious reactions out of 6.6 million doses, including allergic reactions, fever and one death of an elderly person. (Editing by Rob Wilson)</body>

    <body>* Rhinovirus, not swine flu, filled ERs in Philadelphia

* CDC checking to see if it a severe new strain

* Virus mimics swine flu with severe symptoms

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Runny nose, fever, cough, even pneumonia -- the symptoms sound like swine flu but children hospitalized at one U.S. hospital in fact had a rhinovirus, better known as a common cold virus, doctors said on Tuesday.

Hundreds of children treated at Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia had a rhinovirus, and federal health investigators are trying to find out if it was a new strain, and if this is going on elsewhere in the country.

&quot;What began to happen in early September is we started seeing more children coming to our emergency room with significant respiratory illness,&quot; said Dr. Susan Coffin, medical director of infection control and prevention at the hospital.

Doctors and parents assumed it was the new pandemic H1N1 swine flu, which would be expected to re-emerge as schools began in September. But it was not, Coffin said in a telephone interview.

The hospital, unlike most hospitals in the United States, runs a test that can diagnose 10 different respiratory viruses, including influenza but also rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses and other germs that make kids sick.

&quot;The data showed us it wasn&apos;t H1N1 but instead was this rhinovirus infection,&quot; Coffin said.

Usually rhinoviruses cause an annoying but benign illness that looks a lot like flu, but with more runny nose and usually less of a fever. This one was causing severe symptoms and even pneumonia.

&quot;Some of these kids had really bad wheezing,&quot; Coffin said -- so bad they had to be hospitalized and treated with a nebulizer, which delivers drugs into the lungs to help keep oxygen in the blood.

&quot;We don&apos;t terribly often have large numbers of children test positive for it,&quot; Coffin said.

CDC INVESTIGATING

But she estimated that 500 were hospitalized in September and October, with no deaths that she knows of. Starting in mid-October, H1N1 swine flu started to show up, too.

The U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention is investigating, said CDC spokesman Dave Daigle.

&quot;While rhinovirus outbreaks are common in the fall, the outbreak that occurred this year was unusually large and resulted in a lot of hospital admissions, including many children that required intensive care,&quot; Daigle said.

&quot;We&apos;re still testing the strains from the outbreak, but from what we&apos;ve seen so far, it doesn&apos;t appear that there&apos;s a single predominant strain.&quot;

The CDC says while swine flu is above epidemic levels, only 30 percent of cases of so-called influenza-like illness that are tested actually turn out to be H1N1.

Coffin and CDC officials say it is important for people not to assume if they or their children have flu-like symptoms that it was swine flu and that they do not need to be vaccinated.

H1N1 has infected an estimated 22 million people and killed 3,900 in the United States alone. It continues to spread globally and governments are just at the beginning of efforts to vaccinate people against the virus.

There is no vaccine for rhinovirus and no good treatment. For severely ill patients hospitals can try to keep blood oxygen levels up and keep the patients hydrated, often with intravenous lines if they are coughing or wheezing too hard to eat or drink.

    <body>* Poll shows only 46 pct of those offered vaccine say yes

* Doctors say pregnant women particularly reticent

LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - More than half of Britons being offered vaccination against pandemic H1N1 flu are turning it down because they fear side-effects or think the virus is too mild to bother, a survey of doctors showed on Wednesday.

Many of the 107 family doctors polled by Britain&apos;s Pulse magazine said there was widespread resistance from patients and on average only 46 percent of those offered the vaccination agree to have it.

Doctors reported particular difficulties in persuading pregnant women to be vaccinated against the virus, according to Pulse, a trade newspaper for doctors.

&quot;In all the pregnant women we&apos;ve offered it to, I think only about one in 20 has agreed,&quot; Dr Chris Udenze, a family doctor based in Nottingham, central England, said in the survey.

Scepticism has been growing in Britain and other European countries about health authorities&apos; handling of the H1N1 pandemic because the number of people infected has been lower than originally feared [ID:nLB209221].

Britain began a vaccination programme on Oct. 21 sending out doses of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) Pandemrix and Baxter&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan for high-risk hospital patients, front-line healthcare workers, children in seasonal flu risk groups, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.

British health authorities have twice revised down their worst-case scenarios for H1N1 flu, which was declared a pandemic in June and has killed more than 7,000 people worldwide, according to latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Original estimates that as many as 65,000 could die from H1N1 in Britain have now been cut to a prediction of around 1,000 deaths -- way below the average annual toll of 4,000 to 8,000 deaths from seasonal winter flu.

Richard Hoey, Pulse&apos;s editor, said his survey showed that many patients, and &quot;a substantial number of doctors&quot; were &quot;unconvinced there is sufficient evidence that swine flu vaccination is safe and necessary&quot;.</body>

* Asia to get 500,000 course H1N1 antiviral stockpile

* Northern hemisphere hospitals to face &quot;increasing pressure&quot;

* First case of season detected in Vietnam in birds

KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Asia will receive a stockpile of 500,000 courses of H1N1 flu drugs by April next year to supplement any shortfall in the region, an official with a Japanese donor agency said on Tuesday.

The $18 million stockpile is funded by the Japan Trust Fund and is a joint initiative by the country and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), an intercontinental dialogue and cooperation platform.

&quot;The stockpile will be channelled to the Asian countries that need it most, as decided by the World Health Organisation,&quot; Naoko Noda, adviser to the Japan International Cooperation System, told Reuters on the sidelines of an Asia-Europe Foundation pandemic preparedness seminar.

The stockpile will be held in Singapore and will include 400,400 courses of Tamiflu, made by Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX), and 100,000 of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) Relenza antiviral drug.

It is being established as the winter flu season starts to take a grip in the northern hemisphere.

According to the WHO, the pandemic virus has now spread to 206 countries, with the latest reported laboratory-confirmed cases in Somalia, Nigeria and Burundi. There have been more than 6,250 deaths to date, mostly in the Americas, according to the WHO toll.

The WHO&apos;s Western Pacific regional adviser, Dr Takeshi Kasai, said northern hemisphere countries such as South Korea and Japan have so far been able to cope.

&quot;But we are anticipating that the northern hemisphere countries will be facing increasing pressure in the coming months on hospital facilities, particularly intensive care units,&quot; Kasai told Reuters in an interview.

Many Asian countries, added Kasai, have put in place plans to prepare for a pandemic following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

&quot;H1N1 is now the real test to see how the plans the countries have put in place in the past in terms of increasing readiness will work,&quot; said Kasai.

Kasai said Asia&apos;s first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza for this year&apos;s cold season was detected two weeks ago in Vietnam, but the outbreak was limited to a group of birds.

Experts fear that the two types of viruses will combine to become a far more deadly strain among humans. (Reporting by Razak Ahmad; Editing by David Fox)</body>

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials defended the distribution of swine flu vaccines on Tuesday against criticism that their plan to protect Americans was confusing and over-optimistic.

As of Monday, manufacturers had delivered 48.5 million doses of H1N1 vaccine, Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a Senate hearing. HHS had hoped to have as many as 120 million doses by now.

In September HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had assured Congress, &quot;There will be enough vaccines for everyone.&quot;

The problem was worsened because the first vaccine to be available was a nasal spray made by AstraZeneca (AZN.L) unit MedImmune that is not suitable for some of the most vulnerable groups but which is perfect for most schoolchildren and healthcare workers, officials said.

Members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee pressed for an apology and said they felt President Barack Obama&apos;s administration had not learned some valuable lessons from the continuing problem.

&quot;I am worried that we are undermining confidence in our public health system,&quot; said committee chairman, Connecticut independent Sen. Joseph Lieberman.

He worried that people who have waited in vain to be vaccinated against H1N1 swine flu will stop trying.

&quot;This hearing is critical to peeling away the layers of misinformation and miscommunication that has hampered the federal government&apos;s pandemic influenza strategy,&quot; added Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins.

The U.S. government is struggling to vaccinate as many people as possible against the virus, which has infected an estimated 22 million Americans and killed 3,900.

Schuchat acknowledged over-promising vaccine.

&quot;We led expectations of availability to be higher than they have been. I think that led to frustration,&quot; she said.

REVISING DOWNWARD

The vaccination plan was forged after a July meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent group of experts that advises the CDC on vaccine policies.

They agreed to create five broad priority groups totaling 159 million people -- pregnant women, healthcare workers, people with asthma or other conditions that put them at high risk of flu complications, caregivers of infants too young to be vaccinated, and children and adults aged up to 24.

Lieberman said he thought HHS and CDC should have revised the priority groups downward to the 42 million people deemed most in need of vaccination, but Schuchat said the committee met again in October and decided not to modify its recommendations.

&quot;What we heard pretty consistently was leave the flexibility to the state and locals. Let them decide,&quot; she said. Many wanted to run school-based clinics and narrowing the designated priority groups would have meant the most available vaccine -- the spray -- could not be broadly used.

Dr. Nicole Lurie of HHS said the government and Congress need to invest more in public health. &quot;Our nation&apos;s investment in public health infrastructure, particularly at the state and local levels, remains a critical challenge that has real life consequences,&quot; she said.

Separately, vaccine maker Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) said a half-dose of its H1N1 vaccine may be enough to generate a protective immune response. That could in theory stretch the U.S. vaccine supply but would have to be approved by regulators.

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials defended the distribution of swine flu vaccines on Tuesday against criticism that their plan to protect Americans was confusing and over-optimistic.

Manufacturers have delivered 48.5 million doses of H1N1 vaccine, Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a Senate hearing. HHS had hoped to have as many as 120 million doses by now.

The problem was worsened because the first vaccine to be available was a nasal spray made by AstraZeneca (AZN.L) unit MedImmune that is not suitable for some of the most vulnerable groups but which is perfect for most schoolchildren and healthcare workers, officials said.

Members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee pressed for an apology and said they felt President Barack Obama&apos;s administration had not learned some valuable lessons from the continuing problem.

&quot;I am worried that we are undermining confidence in our public health system,&quot; said committee chairman, Connecticut independent Sen. Joseph Lieberman.

He said he feared people who have waited in vain to be vaccinated against H1N1 swine flu will stop trying.

&quot;This hearing is critical to peeling away the layers of misinformation and miscommunication that has hampered the federal government&apos;s pandemic influenza strategy,&quot; added Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins.

The U.S. government is struggling to vaccinate as many people as possible against the virus, which has infected an estimated 22 million Americans and killed 3,900.

In September HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had assured Congress, &quot;There will be enough vaccines for everyone.&quot;

&quot;I think we led expectations of availability to be higher than they have been. I think that led to frustration,&quot; Schuchat said.

ADMITTING MISTAKES

&quot;I think you used the word mistake and it is important to acknowledge that here,&quot; Lieberman said.

HHS spokeswoman Jenny Backus later said Sebelius&apos;s promise was not a mistake.

&quot;The problem has been that lots of people want it all at the same time and that has been a challenge and we understand that people are frustrated,&quot; Backus said by email.

&quot;Vaccine came off the production lines slower than what the original predictions were and we made the tough choice to start the vaccination program as soon as vaccine was ready to go even though we knew that supplies would be low.&quot;

The vaccination plan was chosen at a July meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent group of experts that advises the CDC on vaccine policies.

They agreed to create five broad priority groups totaling 159 million people -- pregnant women, healthcare workers, people with asthma or other conditions that put them at high risk of flu complications, caregivers of infants too young to be vaccinated, and children and adults aged up to 24.

Lieberman said he thought HHS and CDC should have revised the priority groups downward to the 42 million people deemed most in need of vaccination, but Schuchat said the committee met again in October and decided not to modify its recommendations.

&quot;What we heard pretty consistently was leave the flexibility to the state and locals. Let them decide,&quot; she said. Many wanted to run school-based clinics and narrowing the designated priority groups would have meant the most available vaccine -- the spray -- could not be broadly used.

    <body>By Ellen Wulfhorst

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States lags far behind other nations in offering paid sick days, paid parental leave and other workplace benefits that proponents consider vital to public health and workers rights, according to research released on Tuesday.

The eight-year study found the most economically competitive nations offer forms of paid leave to workers that the United States does not, according to researchers at Harvard University and Canada&apos;s McGill University.

Of the world&apos;s 15 most competitive nations, 14 mandate paid sick leave, 13 guarantee paid maternal leave and 12 provide paid paternal leave by law, they said. Eleven provide paid leave to care for children&apos;s health and eight provide paid leave for adult family care.

The United States legally guarantees none of these policies to workers, the authors note. The findings are published in a new book, &quot;Raising the Global Floor: Dismantling the Myth that We Can&apos;t Afford Good Working Conditions for Everyone.&quot;

The issue of paid employee leave in the United States has heated up. Advocates argue paid leave allows sick workers to stay home without financial hardship and helps prevent workers from spreading such diseases as the H1N1 flu.

Advocates for women&apos;s rights argue paid family leave is essential for women, who tend to care more for family members than do men, to compete and advance in the job market.

Opponents argue that mandating such leave policies would cost jobs and be a financial burden on businesses.

&quot;One of the questions that&apos;s consistently asked in the United States is ... will we be able to compete if we have paid sick leave, paid maternity leave?&quot; said author Jody Heymann of McGill&apos;s Institute for Health and Social Policy. &quot;Will there be more unemployment? Will we lose jobs?

&quot;What we found is that none of these policies in any way impede being highly competitive or having low unemployment,&quot; she said.

The 15 nations are Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain and the United States, all of which have been ranked most competitive over the last decade by the World Economic Forum, she said.

Co-authored by Alison Earle, who was a research scientist at Harvard&apos;s School of Public Health, the book is published by Stanford University Press.

Looking more widely at 190 countries, the researchers found 163 guarantee paid sick leave and 164 guarantee paid annual leave.

Also, 177 nations guarantee paid leave for new mothers, 74 nations guarantee paid leave for new fathers and 157 nations guarantee workers a day of rest each week, they said.

The United States has none of these, they said.

Facing the U.S. Congress is a proposed Healthy Families Act, which has the support of the Obama administration. It would require businesses with 15 or more employees to provide up to seven days of paid sick leave per year.

Another proposed act, the Family Leave Insurance Act, would cover paid leave for care of a new child or ill family member.

By Susan Kelly

CHICAGO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Covidien (COV.N) on Tuesday said solid sales of medical devices drove better-than-expected quarterly earnings, and it raised its 2010 sales outlook, sending its shares up 3.5 percent.

Strong sales of surgical stapling products and vessel sealing instruments in the quarter offset soft demand for capital equipment systems, whose sales have been hurt by hospital spending constraints in the weak economy, the company said.

&quot;Strength in medical devices should help put industry volume and hospital inventory de-stocking concerns to rest,&quot; Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis said in a note to clients.

Covidien said it raised its sales outlook for next year based on a weaker U.S. dollar, the acquisition of brain-monitor maker Aspect Medical Systems and recent U.S. regulatory approval of generic versions of cancer pain drug Actiq and topical pain cream Pennsaid.

Dublin-based Covidien posted net profit of $56 million, or 11 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 25, compared with $409 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Net results were reduced by a string of charges related to various divestitures and acquisitions.

The company, which was spun off from Tyco International (TYC.N) in mid-2007, said earnings excluding one-time items were 72 cents a share.

Analysts on average expected a profit of 70 cents a share, before special items, on revenue of $2.62 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Net sales in the quarter were essentially flat at $2.7 billion, with unfavorable foreign exchange translations shaving 2 percentage points off the growth rate, the company said.

Medical device sales rose 7 percent to $1.6 billion, while pharmaceutical sales fell 10 percent to $637 million from a year ago, when it benefited from launching a generic extended-release form of prescription painkiller OxyContin.

Sales of medical supplies, including equipment systems, fell 6 percent to $433 million.

&quot;We continue to see restraints on capital equipment spending across the business,&quot; Covidien Chief Executive Richard Meelia told investors on a conference call.

However, sales of airway and ventilation products got a boost from preparations for the H1N1 virus especially outside the United States, the company said.

For fiscal 2010, Covidien said it now expects sales growth of 6 percent to 9 percent from a year ago. It had previously projected sales growth of 4 percent to 7 percent. It left its operating margin outlook unchanged at 20 percent to 21 percent.

Medical device sales are forecast up 9 percent to 12 percent, while pharmaceutical sales are expected to be flat to up 3 percent.

Shares of Covidien rose $1.56 to $45.67 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago and Krishnakali Sengupta in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D&apos;Silva, Dave Zimmerman)</body>

    <body>KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Asia will receive a stockpile of 500,000 courses of H1N1 flu drugs by April next year to supplement any shortfall in the region, an official with a Japanese donor agency said on Tuesday.

The $18 million stockpile is funded by the Japan Trust Fund and is a joint initiative by the country and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), an intercontinental dialogue and cooperation platform.

&quot;The stockpile will be channeled to the Asian countries that need it most, as decided by the World Health Organization,&quot; Naoko Noda, adviser to the Japan International Cooperation System, told Reuters on the sidelines of an Asia-Europe Foundation pandemic preparedness seminar.

The stockpile will be held in Singapore and will include 400,400 courses of Tamiflu, made by Roche Holding AG, and 100,000 of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s Relenza antiviral drug.

It is being established as the winter flu season starts to take a grip in the northern hemisphere.

According to the WHO, the pandemic virus has now spread to 206 countries, with the latest reported laboratory-confirmed cases in Somalia, Nigeria and Burundi. There have been more than 6,250 deaths to date, mostly in the Americas, according to the WHO toll.

The WHO&apos;s Western Pacific regional adviser, Dr Takeshi Kasai, said northern hemisphere countries such as South Korea and Japan have so far been able to cope.

&quot;But we are anticipating that the northern hemisphere countries will be facing increasing pressure in the coming months on hospital facilities, particularly intensive care units,&quot; Kasai told Reuters in an interview.

Many Asian countries, added Kasai, have put in place plans to prepare for a pandemic following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

&quot;H1N1 is now the real test to see how the plans the countries have put in place in the past in terms of increasing readiness will work,&quot; said Kasai.

Kasai said Asia&apos;s first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza for this year&apos;s cold season was detected two weeks ago in Vietnam, but the outbreak was limited to a group of birds.

Experts fear that the two types of viruses will combine to become a far more deadly strain among humans.

* Total cases - 22 million, range 14 million to 34 million

ESTIMATED HOSPITALIZATIONS

* 0-17 years - 36,000 hospitalizations, with an estimated range from 23,000 to 57,000

* 18-64 years - 53,000 hospitalizations, range 34,000 to 83,000

* 65 and older - 9,000 hospitalizations, range 6,000 to 14,000.

* Total hospitalizations - 98,000, range 63,000 to 153,000

ESTIMATED DEATHS

* 0-17 years - 540 deaths with a potential range of 300 to 800.

* 18-64 years - 2,920 deaths, range 1,900 to 4,600

* 65 years and older - 440 deaths, range 300 to 700

* Total deaths - 3,900 deaths, range 2,500 to 6,100. Source: CDC here</body>

    <body>BERLIN (Reuters) - Confirmed cases of H1N1 swine flu infection in Germany have more than doubled in the past week, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases said.

&quot;We now have more than 15,000 reported new cases per week -- and those are just the ones confirmed in the laboratory,&quot; the RKI&apos;s Gerard Krause told ZDF television on Monday.

Last Wednesday the institute said &quot;about 7,000&quot; new cases were being identified in Europe&apos;s largest economy per week.

As of last week, 16 people had died from the flu in Germany, with more than 50,000 infected, according to the institute.

The H1N1 virus has spread to over 200 countries, and caused more than 6,250 deaths to date, mostly in the Americas region, according to the World Health Organization.

* Internet security firm says gangs mostly Russia-based

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Criminal gangs are making millions of dollars out of the H1N1 flu pandemic by selling fake flu drugs over the internet, a web security firm said on Monday.

Sophos, a British security software firm said it had intercepted hundreds of millions of fake pharmaceutical spam adverts and websites this year, many of them trying to sell counterfeit antiviral drugs like Tamiflu to worried customers.

Tamiflu, an antiviral marketed by Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding (ROG.VX) and known generically as oseltamivir, is the frontline drug recommended by the World Health Organisation to treat and slow the progression of flu symptoms. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) makes another antiviral for flu, known as Relenza.

Sophos said many of the gangs behind the sites were based in Russia and the top five countries buying fake Tamiflu and other medicines on the internet were the United States, Germany, Britain, Canada and France.

Sophos spokesman Graham Cluley said a &quot;worrying trend&quot; towards stockpiling Tamiflu had already been seen in Britain -- Europe&apos;s worst-hit country in the H1N1 pandemic so far.

&quot;As more and more cases of swine flu....come to light, it is essential that we all resist the panic-induced temptation to purchase Tamiflu online,&quot; he said.

&quot;The criminal gangs working behind the scenes at fake internet pharmacies are putting their customers&apos; health, personal information and credit card details at risk.&quot;

The Geneva-based WHO, which declared H1N1 swine flu a pandemic in June, updated its guidance to doctors last week to say that antiviral drugs should be given even before tests conclude that an at-risk patient has the pandemic virus.

Sophos said criminal gangs were operating medicines websites branded as the &quot;Canadian Pharmacy&quot; to try to appear genuine.

It said its research showed that on one network operated out of Russia, called Glavmed, it was possible to earn an average of $16,000 a day promoting pharmaceutical websites.

&quot;But the criminals can be members of more than one affiliate network, and some have boasted of earning more than $100,000 per day,&quot; it said in a statement.

The pandemic H1N1 flu virus has now spread to 206 countries since it was first discovered in March. There have been more than 6,250 deaths to date, mostly in the Americas region, according to the latest WHO toll. (Editing by David Cowell)</body>

    <body>By Grant Gross - IDG News Service\Washington Bureau

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has sent warning letters to 10 Web site operators who have made what the agency called &quot;questionable&quot; claims that products they&apos;re selling can prevent, treat or cure the H1N1 flu, often called swine flu.

The FTC, in letters sent last week, told the U.S. Web site operators that unless they have scientific proof to back up their claims, they are violating U.S. law and must drop the claims. The products offered by the Web sites include dietary supplements, air-filtration systems, homeopathic remedies, items containing silver, and cleaning agents, the FTC said in a press release.

The FTC looked for swine flu product claims as part of the International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network&apos;s 11th Internet sweep, which took place from Sept. 21 to 25. During the sweep, consumer-protection agencies around the world targeted rapidly growing fraudulent and deceptive conduct on the Internet, with a special emphasis on products or services exploiting financial crises or natural disasters such as the H1N1 pandemic, the FTC said.

In addition to sending warning letters to the 10 Web site operators, the FTC referred 14 other site operators located outside the U.S. to foreign law enforcement officials.

&quot;As consumers grow increasingly anxious about obtaining the H1N1 vaccine for their children and other vulnerable family members, scam artists take advantage by selling them bogus remedies online,&quot; David Vladeck, director of the FTC&apos;s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.

The FTC will work with other agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to investigate businesses that promote questionable H1N1 products, the agency said.

The H1N1 virus is thought to spread from person to person in the same way that seasonal flu spreads -- mainly through coughing or sneezing by people with the flu. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes.

Public-health officials advise those worried about catching the flu to wash their hands thoroughly and frequently.</body>

    <summary>... Switzerland has approved Novartis AG&apos;s Celtura H1N1 swine flu vaccine as it rolls out its national vaccination programme ahead of the winter flu season ...</summary>
    <body>ZURICH, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Swiss shares were seen opening higher on Monday, in line with other markets across Europe.

The blue chip SMI index .SSMI was expected to open 25 points higher at 6,376 points, according to pre-market data from bank Clariden Leu CLPRE.

The following are some of the main factors expected to affect Swiss stocks on Monday:

UBS (UBSN.VX)

* UBS may hand over only a small amount of bank data as part of a U.S. settlement because the Internal Revenue Service has succeeded in cracking down on tax evaders, a radio station reported. More than 9,000 Americans had been persuaded to talk about their Swiss bank accounts under a tax amnesty, he added.

* Switzerland&apos;s financial regulator FINMA has received no request from UBS to buy back toxic assets transferred to the Swiss central bank last year, FINMA&apos;s head was quoted on Sunday as saying.

ADDEX (ADXN.S)

Swiss biotech group Addex Pharmaceuticals said its lead drug candidate met its main target in a mid-stage clinical trial in heartburn, potentially paving the way for a lucrative partnering deal.

SWATCH GROUP (UHR.VX)

Swatch Group, the world&apos;s largest watchmaker, should post a second-half operating margin at a similar level to the 14.7 percent posted in the first half of the year if the Swiss franc-dollar exchange rate does not deteriorate further, Chief Executive Nick Hayek was quoted as saying in Sonntag.

Hayek also said he expected 2010 to be a &quot;very good year&quot;, with America likely to be the only market that will suffer a bit longer.

    <title>Air Arabia sees tough conditions into Q2 2010</title>

    <summary>Air Arabia, the largest listed Arab airline by market value, saw third-quarter profit fall 9 percent, a decline it attributed to the global H1N1 flu virus ...</summary>
    <body>DUBAI, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Low-cost carrier Air Arabia (AIRA.DU), which reported its first drop in quarterly profit on Saturday, expects difficult market conditions to extend into the second quarter of next year, an official said on Monday.

Air Arabia, the largest listed Arab airline by market value, saw third-quarter profit fall 9 percent, a decline it attributed to the global H1N1 flu virus pandemic and the fasting month of Ramadan. Profit fell 9 percent to 144 million dirhams ($39 million).

&quot;The market remains challenging,&quot; Paul Suckling, Air Arabia&apos;s director of finance and administration, told a conference call. &quot;We perhaps are starting to see a little bit of improvement but generally, we think Q1 and maybe going into Q2 may still be depressed.

&quot;It&apos;s going to remain as difficult as it has been.&quot;

Suckling said the carrier is targeting passenger load factors -- which show how successful airlines are in filling seats -- of about 80 percent. The measure stood at 79 percent in the nine months to end-September, Air Arabia said.

&quot;There is no reason that should change, we continue to drive our costs down,&quot; Suckling said.

Air Arabia competes with Kuwait-based Jazeera Airways (JAZK.KW) and Saudi-based Nas Air and Sama.

The Sharjah, United Arab Emirates-based airline is launching a new budget carrier with an Egyptian partner and setting up a third hub in Alexandria. It began flying from its Casablanca hub earlier this year.

Suckling said any additions to the Air Arabia fleet next year would likely be put into service in its Egyptian or Moroccan operations.

* Ramadan, H1N1 fears hurt Q3 passenger numbers

(Adds details, background)

DUBAI, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Budget carrier Air Arabia (AIRA.DU) warned of &quot;significant&quot; short-term challenges after posting its first-ever drop in quarterly profit, following the global H1N1 virus flu pandemic and the fasting month of Ramadan.

The largest Arab airline by market value said on Saturday third-quarter net profit fell 9 percent to 144 million dirhams ($39.2 million), beating analyst forecasts.

&quot;Passenger traffic in the third quarter of 2009 was impacted by the seasonality of the Holy month (Ramadan), concerns related to the H1N1 virus and the continuing consequences of the global continuous financial downturn,&quot; it said in a statement.

Challenges ahead remained &quot;significant&quot;, especially in the short term, Chief Executive Adel Ali said in the statement.

The carrier restated third quarter 2008 net profits at 158 million dirhams.

In a survey conducted by Reuters in October, analyst forecasts for third-quarter net profit ranged from 110.2 million dirhams and 129 million dirhams. [ID:nL4505388]

Net profit during the first nine months of the year was up 6 percent from last year at 337 million dirhams.

Passenger numbers between January and September came to 2.96 million, up from 2.6 million a year earlier, the company said, without disclosing third-quarter figures.

The average seat load factor - a measure of how successful airlines are in filling seats - stood at 79 percent in the nine months to end-September, Air Arabia said.

Turnover during the same period fell 2 percent compared to last year, coming in at 1.47 billion dirhams, it said.

Airlines around the world have been crippled by reduced spending on travel, a drop in global trade and rising oil prices.

Air Arabia competes with Kuwait-based Jazeera Airways (JAZK.KW) and Saudi-based Nas Air and Sama. On Thursday, Jazeera Airways posted a 53.2 percent-fall in third-quarter net profit. [ID:nLC473199]

ZURICH, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Switzerland has approved Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG&apos;s (NOVN.VX) Celtura H1N1 swine flu vaccine as it rolls out its national vaccination programme ahead of the winter flu season, regulators said on Friday.

Swissmedic said it was adding Celtura to the list of approved H1N1 vaccines after giving the green light to GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) Pandemrix and Novartis&apos;s Focetria at the end of October. [ID:nLU162500] Celtura was cleared for use in children over three years&apos; old and adults of all ages, although those over 40 years would need two doses, three weeks apart to achieve the necessary level of immunisation, Swissmedic said.

Switzerland has ordered 13 million doses of vaccine from Novartis and Glaxo for its programme to fend off the virus, which could eventually affect 2 billion people globally, according to the World Health Organisation.

Swiss drugmaker Novartis, which has already started to ship doses of its vaccines Fluvirin to the United States and Focetria to other countries around the world, said last week that Germany had already approved Celtura. Novartis has said it expects a fourth-quarter sales boost of up to $700 million from its H1N1 pandemic vaccine.

It has submitted a registration for Celtura in Japan and will seek further approvals in a number of other countries, Novartis said.

(Adds WHO guidance on how to organise mass gatherings)

By Laura MacInnis GENEVA, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Flu infections may be peaking in some parts of the northern hemisphere, but are still spreading fast in others, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

In an update on the H1N1 swine flu virus, the WHO said parts of the southern and southeastern United States, as well as Iceland and Ireland, seemed to have weakening levels of disease after an unusually early start of the winter flu season.

But the U.N. agency, which declared a global flu pandemic in June, said that big sections of the United States were still experiencing &quot;widespread and intense&quot; flu infections.

It described waves of outbreaks across Canada and in Mexico, where the first severe cases were identified earlier this year.

&quot;In Europe and central Asia, overall influenza transmission continues to intensify,&quot; the WHO said, adding that almost all the influenza viruses analysed in Europe in recent weeks have been the H1N1 strain and not seasonal flu.

The pandemic virus has now spread to 206 countries, with the latest reported laboratory-confirmed cases in Somalia, Nigeria and Burundi. There have been more than 6,250 deaths to date, mostly in the Americas region, according to the WHO toll.

While saying &quot;high to very high intensity of respiratory diseases&quot; have been reported in some parts of Europe including Belarus, Bulgaria and Russia, it said experts were now less concerned about a big outbreak in Ukraine.

&quot;The initial analysis of information from Ukraine indicates that the numbers of severe cases do not appear to be excessive when compared to the experience of other countries and do not represent any change in the transmission or virulence of the virus,&quot; it said in a statement posted on the WHO website.

Ukraine and Belarus have recently extended school breaks due to fears about the pandemic virus while Afghanistan declared a health emergency and ordered its schools shut for three weeks to battle it. [ID:nISL499361]

WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said that school closures were among steps that could slow viral spread at the beginning of an outbreak, but had less usefulness once the flu had reached 5 percent of a given population.

&quot;After the virus becomes more widespread in a country, closing schools has less of an impact,&quot; he told a news briefing earlier this week. &quot;If you take a decision to close schools and universities and other institutions you have to be aware there are social and economic consequences of this decision.&quot;

In new guidance also published on Friday, WHO experts said that people planning &quot;mass gatherings&quot; of 1,000 people or more should consult with public health authorities to make sure the events do not amplify the spread of pandemic flu.

&quot;The decision to proceed with a mass gathering or to restrict, modify, postpone or cancel the event should be based on a thorough risk assessment,&quot; it said in the recommendations published on www.who.int.

Guests and participants should also be encouraged to follow the same flu-fighting steps the WHO has widely urged, including to stay home and especially avoid travel when unwell, to clean hands frequently and to cover coughs and sneezes. &quot;Where possible, organisers should consider distancing measures to reduce close contact among people during a mass gathering,&quot; it said, suggesting for example that transport be staggered and food and drink stations spread out to avoid unnecessary congregation.</body>

By Laura MacInnis GENEVA, Nov 13 (Reuters) - The winter flu season that began early in the northern hemisphere this year may be peaking in parts of north America and western Europe, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

In an update on the H1N1 swine flu virus, the WHO said parts of the southern and southeastern United States, as well as Iceland and Ireland, seemed to have weakening levels of disease.

But the U.N. agency, which declared a global flu pandemic in June, said that big sections of the United States were still experiencing &quot;widespread and intense&quot; flu infections.

&quot;The initial analysis of information from Ukraine indicates that the numbers of severe cases do not appear to be excessive when compared to the experience of other countries and do not represent any change in the transmission or virulence of the virus,&quot; it said in a statement posted on the WHO website.

Israel has suffered sharp increases in flu infections and Mongolia has seen a severe impact on its health care system from people falling ill, the WHO said. China and Japan have also experienced continued increases but in much of south and southeast Asia the transmission rates are levelling off.

The H1N1 virus has now spread to 206 countries, with the latest reported laboratory-confirmed cases in Somalia, Nigeria and Burundi. There have been more than 6,250 deaths to date, mostly in the Americas region, according to the WHO toll.

&quot;In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic influenza activity has been reported in recent weeks,&quot; the WHO said, while noting that Buenos Aires has had a cluster of pandemic flu cases.

We had a blockbuster deal this week, with Hewlett-Packard saying it plans to buy 3Com, and a blockbuster settlement, with Advanced Micro Devices and Intel ending a long-running legal dispute. By midnight tonight, Google, the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers are supposed to file a revised book-search settlement proposal, which could add to our top stories list for the week. For now, though, what follows are our top IT headlines of the moment.

1. AMD, Intel settle antitrust, IP disputes and Analysis: Intel, AMD end a bitter business and technical battle: AMD and Intel surprised us with word that they have settled an ongoing antitrust and intellectual-property legal spat. The settlement could have far-reaching effects, even to the point of leading the two rivals to cooperate with one another.

2. HP buying 3Com in $3.7 billion blockbuster and Wall St.: HP-3Com union a real Cisco threat: HP is buying 3Com for US$3.7 billion, which financial analysts said will pose a threat to Cisco.

3. Flash flaw puts most sites, users at risk, say researchers: A Flash flaw of &quot;huge&quot; magnitude is &quot;frighteningly bad,&quot; with the potential for any site to be compromised that allows users to upload content. Yikes!

4. Google goes forward with Go language and Google&apos;s Go is promising, but still in diapers: Google is releasing to open source an experimental programming language called Go, which is said to show a lot of promise but could take years to really take hold.

5. Mobile deathmatch: Motorola Droid vs. iPhone, side by side: There&apos;s nothing quite like a deathmatch, with photos, to amp up the headlines, especially when the matchup is Motorola Droid versus the iPhone.

6. Windows 7 based on Mac design: A gaffe for the ages and Microsoft denies employee&apos;s comments about copying Apple: This story cracked us up, and considering the comments it got and the traffic it drove we weren&apos;t alone. Without a doubt, the comments of a Microsoft employee regarding Windows 7 being based on Mac design were more than a little overblown, but even so, if we were giving an award for the most amusing IT news of the week, this saga would win.

7. EU reveals objections to Oracle-Sun deal: The European Commission released its formal &quot;statement of objections&quot; to Oracle&apos;s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems, revealing why it has found cause to hold up the deal.

8. Adobe to lay off nearly 700 workers and Sprint to lay off more than 2,000: The recession&apos;s ripple effect continued, with word that Adobe will lay off nearly 700 employees and that Sprint Nextel will cut more than 2,000 jobs.

9. Wall Street Beat: Big tech deals stir market: But even as unemployment figures continue to climb, the big IT-related deals of the week gave the financial market a boost.

10. H1N1 drives demand for secure remote access: It might be time to just set up a standing entry for tech-related H1N1 virus news. Once again this week the focus is on how businesses are preparing for the possibility that the flu pandemic will leave a lot of workers unable -- or unwilling -- to come into the office. Vendors of remote-access technologies report stronger-than-expected product demand as a consequence of worries over and preparations for the spread of H1N1.</body>

    <body>BELGRADE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Serbia on Friday signed a contract for the purchase of 3 million doses of new flu vaccinces from Swiss Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), two days after the authorities declared epidemics of the disease.

Novartis and its Serbian representative, the Belgrade-based Jugohemija, will deliver 500,000 vaccines at a price of 8 euros per dose by mid-December, Tanjug news agency said.

The rest will be delivered in batches between January and March, it added.

The Serbian authorities will first innoculate babies, toddlers, pregnant women, the elderly and patients with chronic diseases and only then health workers and employees in public and utility services, including the police and military.

Serbia declared flu epidemics on Nov. 11 after eight people died from the new strain of A/H1N1 virus and more than 250 were diagnosed, but for the time being has stopped short of closing schools or banning public gatherings.

The Public Health Institute believes thousands have been infected but with mild symptoms. (Reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Gordana Filipovic/Will Waterman)</body>

    <body>By Steve Gorman

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Even as they are forced to wait like everyone else for swine flu vaccines in short supply, thousands of nurses and other front-line healthcare workers are fighting mandatory flu immunization policies being put in place by some U.S. hospitals.

The H1N1 pandemic, which has killed about 3,900 Americans so far, has stoked tensions over the best way to safeguard medical caregivers and their patients from flu. Nurses unions have won some early battles against compulsory vaccination.

Most health experts and much of the public agree that medical personnel as a rule should be vaccinated. An infected nurse or technician can pass on a virus that could be deadly to a frail patient. But data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that only about 40 percent of U.S. healthcare workers ever get shots for seasonal influenza.

The question now dividing the medical community is whether it makes more sense to force health workers to get flu shots or to coax them into rolling up their sleeves voluntarily. Proponents of the mandatory route, adopted by a growing number of hospitals, say voluntary efforts largely have fallen short.

&quot;They just don&apos;t work,&quot; said Dr. Neil Fishman, president-elect of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. &quot;The bottom line is vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza.&quot;

He and other advocates of mandatory vaccination point to research they say shows steep declines in patient flu deaths and staff sick days when caregivers are immunized.

&quot;This is a harm that you can prevent,&quot; said Dr. Jonathan Perlin, chief medical officer for the Tennessee-based Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), one of the leading U.S. healthcare chains. It now requires 120,000 of its employees in 21 U.S. states to get seasonal flu shots.

Critics say mandating that healthcare workers get vaccines is misguided, ineffective and ultimately counterproductive.

&quot;There is no evidence that vaccination of healthcare workers in hospitals or outpatient settings has any impact whatsoever on patients,&quot; said Dr. Melanie Swift, head of occupational health for Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee. &quot;You&apos;ve got to vaccinate the patients.&quot;

UNION CHALLENGES

Healthcare workers unions are challenging compulsory flu vaccine policies with some success.

The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics was ordered to halt its mandatory program this month after unions for nearly 5,000 employees there won two binding arbitration rulings that struck down the policy as a contract violation.

Union officials note that the Iowa City facility achieved an 84 percent vaccination rate among its staff last year under its voluntary program, a level considered exemplary.

Swift said this proves the success of educating healthcare workers, some of whom have the same misconceptions and fears about vaccines as the general public. Coercion, she argued, breeds distrust that undermines government safety assurances.

Last month, a New York judge sided with a nurses union and issued a court order against a statewide policy requiring flu shots for all medical workers. Days later, the state suspended its policy, saying the flu vaccine was too scarce to enforce.

Nurses unions also have filed lawsuits against HCA hospitals on behalf of its members in California and Nevada.

Critics of mandatory immunization say the danger posed in hospitals by influenza pales in comparison to many other bugs lurking in medical facilities.

The CDC reports 1.7 million people are stricken each year by all manner of hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, and 99,000 of those die. The number of flu cases among them is unknown but believed to be very small.

When flu is carried unknowingly into hospitals, unvaccinated healthcare workers are hardly the only culprits.

Hospital are filled with visitors who come into close, regular contact with patients, &quot;and their vaccination status is almost never ascertained,&quot; Swift said.

Moreover, seasonal flu vaccines prove largely ineffective in some years against the actual strains that emerge. Thus, all other infection-control measures such as hand-washing and staying home when sick remain key to curbing flu&apos;s spread.

&quot;It is better to be vaccinated than not vaccinated, but it doesn&apos;t preclude the need for all these other controls,&quot; Swift said. &quot;You still have to behave the same way whether you&apos;re vaccinated or not.&quot;

    <body>By Kirby Chien

BEIJING (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group said the number of Greater China companies that list on its exchange could double in as little as two years, fueled by a growing appetite for these shares from a wider range of U.S. institutional investors.

Three of the top 10 performing initial public share offerings in the United States this year are Chinese firms and all listed on Nasdaq, Robert McCooey, the head of global listings and a senior vice president, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.

&quot;The U.S. investor, especially on the institutional side, is very receptive to the Chinese company,&quot; said McCooey, referring to IPOs such as those from video games maker Changyou.com Ltd and Lihua International Inc.

Highlighting that broader appeal, mainland firms are now taking their roadshows to U.S. cities outside of the traditional stops in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, he said.

&quot;They are going to Milwaukee, Minneapolis and St. Louis.&quot;

Chinese firms are not just attracting the attention of portfolio managers focused on China, but also those eyeing more generally global growth businesses across a broad range of industries such as financial, healthcare and the consumer sector, he said.

&quot;They recognize China has the greatest opportunities for their companies,&quot; said McCooey.

That appetite will underpin the China region as Nasdaq&apos;s largest source of foreign company listings in the coming years.

&quot;In two to three years, we will double the number of Chinese listings to 250,&quot; he said.

McCooey said he expected 125 listings from the Greater China area by the end of this year, and mainland firms as a percentage of its total foreign listings to rise from about a third to a half within 3 years.

LARGER PIE

Stock exchanges around the world are competing for business and new listings from China, as Beijing maps out plans to develop domestic capital markets.

The Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing (HKEx), the world&apos;s second-largest listed exchange operator, faces increasing competition from mainland China, as average daily turnover fell 6.6 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter.

Nasdaq was confident the Chinese IPO pie was growing and all exchanges could benefit, even after Beijing introduced last month a new growth enterprise board, Chinext, to provide badly needed funding to start-ups.

&quot;There is plenty for everybody,&quot; he said.

Nasdaq successfully convinced Sinovac Biotech, one of the designated H1N1 flu vaccine producers in China, to transfer its American Exchange-listed shares to the Nasdaq from next week.

Nasdaq&apos;s competitiveness has caught the eye of investors.

While the exchange reported last week its third straight quarterly profit drop, Moody&apos;s Investors Service this week raised its rating on Nasdaq to investment grade and said it may downgrade NYSE Euronext, the latest sign of changing fortunes as exchanges battle for market share.

In a move that could help its profile in China, Nasdaq has already expressed interest to regulators and the Shanghai Stock Exchange to be one of the first foreign companies to list on a proposed international board.

&quot;I absolutely believe it is going to happen,&quot; said McCooey.

The international board could be established next year as large mainland companies such as China Mobile, the world&apos;s largest wireless carrier in terms of subscribers, and CNOOC Ltd, could dual list their shares in Shanghai.

NYSE Euronext, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange and a rival to Nasdaq, is also keen to list in China.

&quot;The U.S. investor, especially on the institutional side, is very receptive to the Chinese company,&quot; said McCooey, referring to IPOs such as those from video games maker Changyou.com Ltd (CYOU.O) and Lihua International Inc (LIWA.O).

Highlighting that broader appeal, mainland firms are now taking their roadshows to U.S. cities outside of the traditional stops in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, he said.

&quot;They are going to Milwaukee, Minneapolis and St. Louis.&quot;

Chinese firms are not just attracting the attention of portfolio managers focused on China, but also those eyeing more generally global growth businesses across a broad range of industries such as financial, healthcare and the consumer sector, he said.

&quot;They recognize China has the greatest opportunities for their companies,&quot; said McCooey.

That appetite will underpin the China region as Nasdaq&apos;s largest source of foreign company listings in the coming years.

&quot;In two to three years, we will double the number of Chinese listings to 250,&quot; he said.

McCooey said he expected 125 listings from the Greater China area by the end of this year, and mainland firms as a percentage of its total foreign listings to rise from about a third to a half within 3 years.

LARGER PIE

Stock exchanges around the world are competing for business and new listings from China, as Beijing maps out plans to develop domestic capital markets.

The Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing (HKEx) (0388.HK), the world&apos;s second-largest listed exchange operator, faces increasing competition from mainland China, as average daily turnover fell 6.6 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter. [ID:nHKG247824]

Nasdaq was confident the Chinese IPO pie was growing and all exchanges could benefit, even after Beijing introduced last month a new growth enterprise board, Chinext, to provide badly needed funding to start-ups.

&quot;There is plenty for everybody,&quot; he said.

Nasdaq successfully convinced Sinovac Biotech SVA.A, one of the designated H1N1 flu vaccine producers in China, to transfer its American Exchange-listed shares to the Nasdaq from next week.

Nasdaq&apos;s competitiveness has caught the eye of investors.

While the exchange reported last week its third straight quarterly profit drop, Moody&apos;s Investors Service this week raised its rating on Nasdaq to investment grade and said it may downgrade NYSE Euronext (NYX.N), the latest sign of changing fortunes as exchanges battle for market share. [ID:nN116902]

In a move that could help its profile in China, Nasdaq has already expressed interest to regulators and the Shanghai Stock Exchange to be one of the first foreign companies to list on a proposed international board.

&quot;I absolutely believe it is going to happen,&quot; said McCooey.

The international board could be established next year as large mainland companies such as China Mobile (0941.HK), the world&apos;s largest wireless carrier in terms of subscribers, and CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK), could dual list their shares in Shanghai.

NYSE Euronext, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange and a rival to Nasdaq, is also keen to list in China.

    <body>By Jaikumar Vijayan - Computerworld

The H1N1 pandemic is pushing companies to upgrade their secure remote access capabilities in order to enable more employees to work out of their homes and other remote locations in an emergency.

Vendors of remote access technologies are reporting an unexpected increase in demand for their products over the past several months as a result of H1N1-related concerns.

&quot;What companies are really looking for is the ability to provide secure, remote access to more of their employees,&quot; said Michael Oldham, CEO of Portcullis Systems, a Marlborough, Mass.-based vendor of secure access appliances. &quot;Most companies already have mobile workforces. What they are doing is planning for scale,&quot; he said.

Much of the increased interest has come from government agencies and larger enterprises, Oldham said. &quot;They are the ones that seem to be more aware of the need for planning. We have seen a number of these organizations purchasing lately with H1N1 in mind,&quot; Oldham said.

Secure access technologies such as those offered by Portcullis and other vendors provide teleworkers with secure access to enterprise applications from any location, using a broad range of devices. They enable IT administrators to enforce security and information usage policies. These security enhancements are used to make sure that any devices connected to a corporate network from a remote location meets internal security requirements.

Such tools can be vital to enabling business continuity during a pandemic, said Sam Curry, vice president of product management and strategy at RSA, the security division of EMC Corp.

Last spring, when H1N1 pandemic fears were at their peak in Mexico, RSA saw a massive spike in demand for its SecurID authentication tokens from companies with operations in that country, Curry said. One company, which is among the largest producers in the food and beverage industry, placed an order for nearly 50,000 tokens to be delivered in a single day, he said. &quot;They were fork-lifting thousands of these things directly to their operations in Mexico,&quot; to ensure they kept running through the worst of the crisis, Curry said.

The RSA tokens enable a company to implement two-factor authentication for accessing enterprise networks and applications. Many companies provide these tokens to workers who log in to company networks from remote locations. The Mexican company, which he would not name, already had a well-established infrastructure in place and easily implemented the additional tokens, he said. But most other companies would need to do some advance planning to quickly expand their remote workforce, Curry said.

As part of an effort to help companies support more teleworkers in a hurry, RSA recently introduced an on-demand authentication system that companies can use to enable workers to securely log in from remote locations. Instead of hardware-based tokens, workers get one-time passwords sent via SMS (short message service) to their mobile phones. A worker logging in from home would go to a self-service Web site and request a one-time password to be sent to his mobile phone. That password can then be used to securely log-in to the company&apos;s network.

Though the SMS-based approach is less secure than RSA&apos;s hardware tokens, they are ideal for when companies need to quickly support an expanded remote workforce, Curry said.

SonicWall, a vendor of secure SSL (secure sockets layer) VPN appliances has recently added a 10-day &quot;spike license&quot; option for large customers that need to temporarily support more employees working out of their homes and other remote locations. The license allows companies that are running SonicalWall VPN appliances to temporarily increase the number of users that are licensed to log in remotely via VPN. For example, a company that might have purchased a 500-user license would temporarily get the ability to support 2,000 users, by using the spike license option.

SonicWall has been offering a 30-day and a 90-day spike license option for some time, but decided to add a 10-day option to address requests from customers planning for the H1N1 outbreak,said Chris Witeck, director of product management at SonicWall.

&quot;We have definitely seen larger organizations expressing much more interest in incorporating pandemic planning into their disaster recovery plans. We have seen them alter their (business continuity and DR) plans in preparing for H1N1,&quot; he said.

SonicWall has seen greater interest in its spike licenses after the company introduced the 10-day option, Witeck said, and the interest is not limited to the U.S. market. H1N1-related planning exercises have resulted in increased demand for SonicWall&apos;s products especially in Japan where concern over the pandemic seems to be especially high, he said.

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - H1N1 swine flu killed an estimated 3,900 Americans from April to October, including more than 500 children, U.S. health officials said on Thursday.

More complete data and more comprehensive calculations than previously released now show that, in the first six months of the pandemic, H1N1 infected an estimated 22 million Americans and put 98,000 in the hospital, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Of these totals, children account for 8 million of the infected, 36,000 of those in hospital and 540 deaths.

&quot;I have already seen a larger number of deaths than we have had for several years,&quot; the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters. &quot;I do believe the pediatric death toll from this pandemic will be extensive and much greater than what we see with seasonal flu.&quot;

In an average flu season, about 82 children die in the United States, the CDC says. But those are lab-confirmed cases, which Schuchat points out are far lower than the kinds of estimates released on Thursday.

For the first six months of this pandemic, 129 U.S. children who died had lab-confirmed H1N1 flu.

The CDC said swine flu is causing the worst flu season in the United States since 1997, when current measurements started.

&quot;What we are seeing in 2009 is unprecedented,&quot; Schuchat said. &quot;Influenza is really serious. The vaccines we have are the best way to protect patients.&quot;

But the vaccines are being produced and distributed slowly. Schuchat said 41.6 million doses were available or had been distributed but this is far below what had been expected.

&quot;Last week we did mention that we had been led to expect about 8 million doses this week,&quot; Schuchat said. &quot;Based on what we have today, we aren&apos;t expecting to meet that estimate that the manufacturers gave us.&quot;

Many things can go wrong with flu vaccine production, Schuchat noted.

QUICK ANTIVIRALS

The CDC said doctors need to treat cases of severe flu quickly with the antiviral drugs Tamiflu, made by Roche AG (ROG.VX), Relenza, made by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), or for severe hospitalized cases, peramivir, made by BioCryst (BCRX.O).

But a team of CDC experts said in a report released on Thursday that only about 75 percent of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 get them.

Schuchat stressed that the pandemic is not worsening but noted that it takes time to gather data on flu cases and deaths. Thursday&apos;s count is not an actual reckoning of deaths but is an extrapolation based on detailed data from 10 states.

CDC&apos;s precise count of confirmed flu deaths is 1,265.

&quot;For influenza it&apos;s virtually impossible to find every case with a lab test. So the estimation method we are using now we believe gives a bigger picture, a probably more accurate picture of the full scope of the pandemic,&quot; Schuchat said.

In an average flu season, about 36,000 Americans die and 200,000 are hospitalized. But 90 percent of these are people over 65.

With H1N1, the opposite is true -- 90 percent of those infected and seriously ill are younger adults and children.

And Schuchat pointed out that it is only November. &quot;We have a long flu season ahead of us,&quot; she said. The U.S. flu season usually runs from October to May.

Most of the confirmed flu cases are H1N1 flu and about 30 percent of people who show up at the doctor&apos;s office and are actually tested for influenza turn out to have flu, as opposed to some other infection. (Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; editing by Todd Eastham)</body>

    <body>* U.N. agency changes recommendations for treating flu

* Can avert severe pneumonia and deadly complications

By Laura MacInnis

GENEVA, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Antiviral medicines can prevent H1N1 flu deaths and should be given quickly to pregnant women, very young children and people with underlying medical problems who fall ill, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday.

Announcing a change of its guidance to doctors, the United Nations health agency said the drugs should be administered even before tests conclude that an at-risk patient has the pandemic virus and not something else.

&quot;We have updated our clinical guidance to emphasise that seeking early medical attention can save lives,&quot; Nikki Shindo of the WHO&apos;s global influenza programme told journalists on a teleconference.

The H1N1 strain, which the WHO declared a global pandemic in June, can cause severe pneumonia in previously healthy people. It has killed more than 6,000 people and spread to 199 countries since its discovery in North America earlier this year.

Pregnant women, children under the age of 2 and people with respiratory problems and other diseases are at highest risk of the extreme effects of swine flu, which can take hold as soon as one week after infection by the highly contagious virus.

&quot;The window of opportunity is very narrow to reverse the progression of the disease,&quot; Shindo said. &quot;The medicine needs to be administered before the virus destroys the lungs.&quot;

The new clinical guidelines also recommend that people outside the at-risk group who have &quot;persistent or rapidly worsening symptoms,&quot; such as problems breathing or a high fever for more than three days, should take antivirals.

These should be administered by a doctor, and are not needed by people who have only a typical cold, Shindo stressed.

TAMIFLU, GENERICS

Tamiflu, an antiviral marketed by Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding ROG.VS and known generically as oseltamivir, is the frontline drug recommended by the WHO as a way to treat and slow the progression of flu symptoms.

Other companies including India&apos;s Cipla Ltd (CIPL.BO) make generic versions of Tamiflu. The H1N1 virus has not shown much resistance to the drug partly because the new strain has not mutated or changed as it has spread around the world. [ID:nNWLA7419]

Shindo said the virus was &quot;amazingly stable,&quot; reflecting the fact that it can easily breach the immune systems of people who lack natural defences to the strain, which had never been seen before its emergence in Mexico and the United States.

Many hospitals and clinics, especially in poorer countries, have been overwhelmed with patients seeking care for H1N1 as the northern hemisphere has entered its winter flu season.

Shindo said early treatment of at-risk and severe patients with oseltamivir could help ease that strain.

The WHO shipped antiviral drugs to 72 countries in May as the pandemic began to gain speed, and recently sent stocks of the medicines to Afghanistan, Mongolia, Belarus and Ukraine.

It will soon send more supplies to Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan. (Additional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by Robin Pomeroy)</body>

GENEVA (Reuters) - Antiviral medicines can prevent severe H1N1 flu and should be given to pregnant women, very young children and people with underlying medical problems who fall ill, a World Health Organisation official said on Thursday.

&quot;In at-risk groups, in order to prevent progression to severe disease, antivirals need to be administered early,&quot; Nikki Shindo of the WHO&apos;s global influenza program said.

&quot;This also holds for otherwise healthy people who show progressive symptoms,&quot; she told a teleconference. &quot;Patients with pneumonia also should be treated with antiviral medicines, antibiotics, oxygen, and balanced fluid management.&quot;

The WHO has previously said there were only &quot;isolated and infrequent&quot; cases of resistance to antivirals like osetamivir, marketed by Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding.

Shindo said the pandemic virus had not mutated and that research undertaken since H1N1 emerged earlier this year had shown that antiviral drugs were safe in pregnant women, children under the age of two, and other vulnerable patients.

&quot;We are changing the recommendations to make (them) more explicit about early treatment,&quot; she said.

Many doctors have been waiting for laboratory confirmation that patients are infected with H1N1, and not something else, before administering antiviral drugs.

Shindo said doctors in places where the virus is known to be circulating &quot;should not wait for the laboratory information&quot; to start such treatment in high-risk groups.

But she also stressed that healthy people should not take antiviral drugs unless their symptoms worsen quickly, and said that most H1N1 patients would recover without needing any medicines or hospital care.

Hospitals in Afghanistan, Ukraine and Moldova have reported being overwhelmed with patients with H1N1 flu, said Shindo, who suggested early antiviral treatment could help ease this strain.

&quot;One way to save lives and lighten the burden on the health care system is to prevent severe disease,&quot; she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - H1N1 swine flu killed an estimated 3,900 Americans from April to October, including more than 500 children, U.S. health officials said on Thursday.

Better data than was previously available shows the flu pandemic has infected an estimated 22 million Americans and put 98,000 in the hospital, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Children account for 8 million of the infected, 36,000 of those hospitalized and 540 deaths.

&quot;We think the 540 number is a better estimate for the big picture that we are getting out there,&quot; the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters.

About 82 U.S. children die in an average flu season. The CDC said H1N1 has produced the worst flu season in the United States since 1997, when current measurements started.

Schuchat stressed the pandemic was not worsening but noted that it takes time to gather data on flu cases and deaths. The count released on Thursday is not an actual reckoning of deaths but an extrapolation based on detailed data from 10 states.

CDC&apos;s previous estimate of U.S. flu deaths was 1,200.

In an average flu season, about 36,000 Americans die and 200,000 are hospitalized with 90 percent of deaths and hospitalizations among people over 65.

With H1N1, 90 percent of those infected and seriously ill are younger adults and children.

Schuchat said the pandemic would likely continue through the winter and early spring. &quot;We have a long flu season ahead of us,&quot; she said.

Most confirmed flu cases are H1N1 and about 30 percent of people who show up at the doctor&apos;s office and are actually tested for influenza turn out to have flu, as opposed to some other infection.

By Susan Heavey

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration defended the agency&apos;s decision not to use an additive that could have stretched swine flu vaccine supplies, adding that doses should be coming more regularly.

The vaccine to prevent the H1N1 strain of influenza has been in short supply following production issues but more doses are becoming available, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said on Thursday at the Reuters Health Summit in New York.

&quot;The gap between need and availability is narrowing. I think we are going to see doses coming off the lines and into people&apos;s arms or noses on a regular basis now,&quot; Hamburg said.

U.S. health officials have been scrambling to get the swine flu vaccine to market after the virus emerged too late to be included in this year&apos;s regular seasonal flu version. Initially, officials said there would be enough for everyone, but the public quickly grew frustrated when supplies ran short.

The FDA has approved H1N1 vaccine from five makers who already produce seasonal flu vaccine -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc, AstraZeneca Plc&apos;s MedImmune unit, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, and CSL Limited.

Both products use an egg-based technology to produce the vaccine, but the H1N1 virus grew slower than expected in the eggs, Hamburg said. She added the agency is working with manufacturers to move toward other, more efficient technology such as cell-based cultures that could spur production.

Hamburg said it was not too late for people to benefit from immunization.

Some experts have suggested the government could have increased supplies by embracing adjuvant vaccine technology that is widely used in Europe.

Adjuvanted vaccines contain an additive to boost the immune system response and need less of the active ingredient than the unadjuvanted types approved by the FDA.

But Hamburg said they have not been widely tested and that the agency did not want to risk using them when standard vaccines worked well with a single dose.

&quot;Had the shape of epidemic or the characteristics of the virus and the disease required it, we would have moved toward an adjuvanted approach,&quot; she said.

&quot;Europe took a little bit more of a risk. Yes, there was experience with an adjuvanted vaccine but it was really only used in the elderly and there wasn&apos;t experience with that vaccine in other populations, including pregnant women and children.&quot;

Still, people remain wary of vaccine supplies and the public outcry has prompted the White House to look into the issue. It is still somewhat unclear when enough vaccine will become available to patients to meet demand.

Earlier on Thursday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said they had expected 8 million H1N1 vaccine doses this week but that they are unsure how many they will get.

Hamburg, who took office in May, said that while the government may have over-promised on the availability of the vaccine earlier this year, lessons had been learned.  Continued...

    <body>By Kate Kelland - Analysis

LONDON (Reuters) - European scientists and health authorities are facing angry questions about why H1N1 flu has not caused death and destruction on the scale first feared, and they need to respond deftly to ensure public support.

Accusations are flying in British and French media that the pandemic has been &quot;hyped&quot; by medical researchers to further their own cause, boost research grants and line the pockets of drug companies.

Britain&apos;s Independent newspaper this week asked &quot;Pandemic? What Pandemic?.&quot;

In their response, scientists are walking a fine line.

They say that although the virus is mild, it can still kill, and that the relatively low fatalities in Europe are in part the result of official response to their advice.

On suggestions of &quot;hyping&quot; the threat to boost research funding, they point out that while we know enough to start to protect the vulnerable, we need to know a lot more to conquer the virus, and funding for new research and drugs is vital to be equipped for future pandemics.

H1N1 is hitting a younger population -- adults in their 20s and 30s and children -- and the global death count so far is more than 6,000, according to the WHO.

While seasonal flu attacks about 20 percent of the population in an average year, experts estimate that even in Britain -- the worst-hit country in Europe so far -- fewer than 10 percent of people have had H1N1 swine flu.

Fred Hayden, influenza research co-ordinator at the Wellcome Trust and a former World Health Organization (WHO) expert, said early planning is paying off, but added:

&quot;I wouldn&apos;t characterize this as a &quot;mild&quot; pandemic at all. We are seeing some very unfortunate loss of life. I think it a bit early to make that judgment.&quot;

Yet the word &quot;mild&quot; is used so often to describe H1N1&apos;s impact in most people that it is prompting skeptical publics to ask what all the fuss is about. Why they should care? And why take a vaccine?

France&apos;s Le Parisien newspaper ran the headline: &quot;Swine flu: why the French distrust the vaccine&quot; and noted a gap between the predicted impact of H1N1 and the less dramatic reality.

&quot;Although some 30-odd people have died....the disease is not really frightening,&quot; it said. &quot;Dangerous liaisons between certain experts, the labs and the government, the obscurity of the contracts between the state and the pharma firms have added to the doubt.&quot;

SCENARIO REVISED DOWN

In Britain, health authorities&apos; original worst-case scenario -- which said as many as 65,000 could die from H1N1 -- has twice been revised down and the prediction is now for around 1,000 deaths, way below the average annual toll of 4,000 to 8,000 deaths from seasonal winter flu.

A group of eminent scientists who called a media briefing in London this week to announce 7.5 million pounds ($12.4 million) of new funding for British research into H1N1 found their plans hijacked by reporters asking why the pandemic was so weak.

Scientists say the truth is they can&apos;t win.

The WHO has been urging countries to prepare for a flu pandemic since 1997, when H5N1 avian flu infected 18 people in Hong Kong and was stopped only after a mass slaughter of birds. The re-emergence of H5N1 in China and South Korea in 2003 fueled the urgency to get ready.

Now that it has arrived, the apparently low impact of the H1N1 pandemic so far may show that the planning is paying off, the Wellcome Trust&apos;s Hayden said.

British officials repeatedly said the nation was well-prepared for a flu pandemic. It had high stocks of antivirals and orders for enough vaccines to cover its population in place very early.

Hayden said comparisons with earlier flu pandemics like the one in 1918, which killed an estimated 230,000 people in Britain and up to 50 million worldwide, were skewed by the fact that there were so few effective treatments at that time.

&quot;We didn&apos;t have antivirals then, and we didn&apos;t have antibiotics for the high frequency of bacterial complications,&quot; he said. &quot;We have these kinds of interventions now and they are making a difference.&quot;

At the funding briefing, Peter Openshaw, director of the center for respiratory infection at Imperial College London, dismissed suggestions that scientists were enjoying the fruits of a pandemic in the form of big grants to keep them in work.

&quot;This is not something that we are licking our lips and welcoming,&quot; he said. &quot;But there is certainly an enormous outbreak of scientific information that has greatly enriched our understanding of flu.&quot;

By Laura MacInnis

GENEVA, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Antiviral medicines can prevent H1N1 flu deaths and should be given quickly to pregnant women, very young children and people with underlying medical problems who fall ill, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday.

Announcing a change of its guidance to doctors, the United Nations health agency said the drugs should be administered even before tests conclude that an at-risk patient has the pandemic virus and not something else.

&quot;We have updated our clinical guidance to emphasise that seeking early medical attention can save lives,&quot; Nikki Shindo of the WHO&apos;s global influenza programme told journalists on a teleconference.

The H1N1 strain, which the WHO declared a global pandemic in June, can cause severe pneumonia in previously healthy people. It has killed more than 6,000 people and spread to 199 countries since its discovery in North America earlier this year.

Pregnant women, children under the age of 2 and people with respiratory problems and other diseases are at highest risk of the extreme effects of swine flu, which can take hold as soon as one week after infection by the highly contagious virus.

&quot;The window of opportunity is very narrow to reverse the progression of the disease,&quot; Shindo said. &quot;The medicine needs to be administered before the virus destroys the lungs.&quot;

The new clinical guidelines also recommend that people outside the at-risk group who have &quot;persistent or rapidly worsening symptoms,&quot; such as problems breathing or a high fever for more than three days, should take antivirals.

These should be administered by a doctor, and are not needed by people who have only a typical cold, Shindo stressed.

TAMIFLU, GENERICS

Tamiflu, an antiviral marketed by Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding ROG.VS and known generically as oseltamivir, is the frontline drug recommended by the WHO as a way to treat and slow the progression of flu symptoms.

Other companies including India&apos;s Cipla Ltd (CIPL.BO) make generic versions of Tamiflu. The H1N1 virus has not shown much resistance to the drug partly because the new strain has not mutated or changed as it has spread around the world. [ID:nNWLA7419]

Shindo said the virus was &quot;amazingly stable,&quot; reflecting the fact that it can easily breach the immune systems of people who lack natural defences to the strain, which had never been seen before its emergence in Mexico and the United States.

Many hospitals and clinics, especially in poorer countries, have been overwhelmed with patients seeking care for H1N1 as the northern hemisphere has entered its winter flu season.

Shindo said early treatment of at-risk and severe patients with oseltamivir could help ease that strain.

The WHO shipped antiviral drugs to 72 countries in May as the pandemic began to gain speed, and recently sent stocks of the medicines to Afghanistan, Mongolia, Belarus and Ukraine.

It will soon send more supplies to Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan. (Additional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by Robin Pomeroy)</body>

    <body>* Costs of not vaccinating Canadians would be huge

* No sign virus has peaked, says chief medical officer

By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Canada&apos;s top medical official defended the national H1N1 vaccination campaign on Thursday, and said the costs of doing nothing would be far higher than the money spent immunizing millions of people.

The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing medical data from various levels of government, said Canada has so far spent C$1.5 billion ($1.4 billion) on the campaign -- more than twice as much as officials initially estimated.

But Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, said millions of people could become sick and thousands die if there was no vaccination program.

So far around 20 percent of Canada&apos;s 34 million population have been immunized, and there is no sign the virus has peaked, he said.

&quot;This is a preventable disease. That&apos;s the key thing,&quot; said Butler-Jones, who declined to give a cost for the campaign.

&quot;There&apos;s the cost for actually doing what we&apos;re doing and the cost if we don&apos;t, in terms of millions of illnesses, all those people off (work), lost productivity, people in hospital ... and people dying as a result of uncontrolled infection,&quot; he told reporters in Ottawa.

&quot;That&apos;s going to be so many times what we&apos;re spending.&quot;

The vaccination campaign has been dogged with problems. Initial apathy was replaced by hours-long lines at vaccination clinics after a couple of high-profile deaths, and accompanied by anger that some people seemed to be jumping the line.

Complaints centers on flu shots for hospital board members, hockey players and -- according to initial reports -- prisoners held by Canada&apos;s forces in Afghanistan. The defense ministry later denied that was the case.

The H1N1 shot is currently available only for children, the elderly and those considered at high risk of complications. Butler-Jones said all Canadians who wanted the shot would be able to have it by the end of December.

&quot;There&apos;s no evidence that the virus has peaked ... we&apos;ve still got a long way to go,&quot; he said.

The Globe and Mail said the cost of obtaining and injecting a single dose of the vaccine was initially put at C$16. This rose to C$30, partly as demand surged unexpectedly last month.

An Ekos poll for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp on Thursday said 53 percent of Canadians felt the level of concern about H1N1 was exaggerated.

Separately, health officials said children aged between three and nine would only need one dose of the vaccine as opposed to two. Butler-Jones said this would free up doses for other sections of the population deemed to be high-risk. ($1=$1.06 Canadian) (Reporting by David Ljunggren)</body>

By Sam Cage

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sales of flu treatments due to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic may be sustainable beyond the current winter season, as governments around the world overhaul their long-term strategy on stockpiles.

GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) Chief Executive Andrew Witty said on Thursday that pandemic stockpiling would be a recurrent business, rather than a simple one-off, with some 60 countries now running strategic reserves of both vaccines and antivirals.

&quot;I think what that will lead to is a lower level, but still I think a material level, of potential sales to government stockpiling environments over the next few years,&quot; he told the Reuters Health Summit.

&quot;It&apos;s going to be a material piece of business for the company.&quot;

H1N1 swine flu continues to spread and has killed thousands of people around the world. Many countries are working to vaccinate their populations but vaccine production is slow.

Glaxo has said analyst forecasts for about 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) of H1N1 vaccine sales in the fourth quarter are broadly accurate, and similar numbers are forecast for the first quarter 2010.

Investors and analysts have questioned the sustainability of sales of vaccines and antivirals like Glaxo&apos;s Relenza, which hit 464 million pounds in the nine months to end-September.

But Witty said this missed the point that increasing numbers of governments would in future be maintaining and refreshing stockpiles of treatments against the risk of another pandemic -- even though this may be decades away.

He added that it was misleading to think of pandemic sales as a windfall for manufacturers, since drugmakers like Glaxo had been researching and investing heavily for such an eventuality.

SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS

Others are also benefiting -- including Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), which makes antiviral Tamiflu, and rival vaccine makers like Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and Baxter International Inc (BAX.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz).

&quot;After this particular spike is gone, my belief is that those institutions (government stockpiles) will stay in place -- this notion of being ready and better-prepared for next time,&quot; Witty said.

Pandemic flu will be a &quot;very significant business&quot; for Glaxo through until March and probably also in the second quarter of next year, he said. After that much will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, how many countries maintain stockpiles and of what size.

&quot;We&apos;ve spent the best part of 15 years investing for this situation ... so I&apos;m just going to slightly push back on this notion that we just sat around waiting for this to fall out of the sky,&quot; Witty said.

&quot;We&apos;ve done a lot to put ourselves in a situation to be a supplier.&quot;

    <body>* Conservatives slip but maintain 10-point lead

* Liberals near the poor showing from last year&apos;s election

* Another minority government would be most likely

OTTAWA, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Canada&apos;s governing Conservatives are maintaining a double-digit lead in public support over the rival Liberal Party though they have slipped from polling levels normally seen necessary to form a majority government.

An Ekos poll released on Thursday showed the Conservatives at 36.6 percent, down from 37.4 percent a week ago, and the Liberals at 26.6 percent, down from 26.8 percent.

&quot;The parties now appear to be fairly &apos;locked in&apos; to support levels consistent with the last election. There does not appear to be anything in the handling of the H1N1 (flu) crisis which is likely to disrupt that pattern,&quot; Ekos President Frank Graves said.

&quot;What must be most worrisome for the Liberals is that while the Conservatives have slipped somewhat in the last month, none of that shift has accrued to them.&quot;

The Conservatives won re-election in October 2008 with a minority government, one that requires the support of at least one opposition party. The current poll standings show that would again be the most likely result.

The Liberals are less than half a point above their 2008 election result, their worst showing in terms of percentage of vote in more than a century. They came in third place in four partial elections held this week to fill vacant seats.

Their support deteriorated after deciding in September to try to force a new election.

Ekos has the leftist New Democrats at 16.8 percent, the Greens at 11.2 percent and the separatist Bloc Quebecois at 8.8 percent.

The automated telephone survey from Nov. 4-10 covered 3,502 Canadians, a sample size that should be accurate to within 1.7 percentage points 19 times out of 20. (Reporting by Randall Palmer, editing by Vicki Allen)</body>

    <body>ROME (Reuters) - An Italian inventor has combined faith and ingenuity to come up with a way to keep church traditions alive for the faithful without the fear of contracting swine flu -- an electronic holy water dispenser.

The terracotta dispenser, used in the northern town of Fornaci di Briosco, functions like an automatic soap dispenser in public washrooms -- a churchgoer waves his or her hand under a sensor and the machine spurts out holy water.

&quot;It has been a bit of a novelty. People initially were a bit shocked by this technological innovation but then they welcomed it with great enthusiasm and joy. The members of this parish have got used to it,&quot; said Father Pierangelo Motta.

Catholics entering and leaving churches usually dip their hands into fonts full of holy water -- which has been blessed by a priest -- and make the sign of the cross.

But fear of contracting the H1N1 virus has led many in Italy -- where some 15 people have died of swine flu -- not to dip their hands in the communal water font.

&quot;It&apos;s great,&quot; said worshipper Marta Caimm as she entered the church. &quot;Thanks to this we are not worried about catching swine flu. It is the right thing for the times,&quot; she said.

Luciano Marabese, who invented the dispenser, said he did so out of concern that fear of swine flu was eroding traditions.

And he is now blessing himself all the way to the bank.

&quot;After all the news that some churches, like Milan&apos;s cathedral, were suspending the use of holy water fonts as a measure against swine flu, demands for my invention shot to the stars. I have received orders from all over the world,&quot; he said.

* Firm skipped last year&apos;s party amid financial crisis

NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - There will be no eggnog for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) this year.

Wall Street&apos;s dominant firm -- much-criticized for paying out-sized bonuses so soon after taking a government bailout -- is forgoing its Christmas party, spokeswoman Gia Moron said.

The bank also skipped its year-end party last year, as the financial sector was reeling from the demise of Lehman Brothers.

Goldman is weeks away from deciding how much to pay its top employees at year-end. It has reported more than $3 billion in profits in each of the past two quarters and so far this year has set aside nearly $17 billion for compensation and benefits.

The firm&apos;s public-relations struggles extend beyond the realm of pay. Last week, the firm was one of several banks to receive doses of H1N1 flu vaccines for distribution to at-risk employees.

    <body>* Tymoshenko says Yushchenko endangering lives by inaction

* Yushchenko refuses to sign law for cash to fight epidemic

(Adds Tymoshenko on IMF)

By Richard Balmforth

KIEV, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine&apos;s president and prime minister hurled angry accusations at each other on Wednesday over ways of fighting an influenza epidemic, now a major factor in campaigning for a January election in which they are rivals.

A total of 189 people have died in the outbreak, the health ministry said, and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has cancelled political rallies and ordered schools shut to try to curb it.

The toll included 17 deaths from the H1N1 flu, First Deputy Health Minister Vasily Lazorishinets told journalists.

The health scare has caused panic across Ukraine and has become, like other hot issues such as contacts with the International Monetary Fund, a political football between President Viktor Yushchenko and Tymoshenko, both contenders in the Jan. 17 poll for president.

Weighing in against Yushchenko, Tymoshenko told ministers that the President, by failing to approve a law to release $125 million to fight the outbreak, was endangering human life.

&quot;Without the signing of this law, the government can not fight this epidemic today,&quot; she said.

&quot;The action of the President ... is an action today against Ukraine. The President will be responsible for every person who is ill today or dies.&quot;

Yushchenko, who in late October gave the go-ahead to rises in pensions and the minimum wage in defiance of the IMF and pleas by Tymoshenko, hit back immediately.

Signing a proposed law to release anti-flu funds would lead to new money being printed and a devaluation of the national currency, the hryvnia, he said.

&quot;I will not be the author of such a policy. I don&apos;t need to be blackmailed. I have the right of President. I am taking a decision (to veto the bill) and it&apos;s taken,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.

Implying further criticism of Yushchenko, Tymoshenko said Ukraine&apos;s economy will undergo an &quot;extremely difficult&quot; period without $3.8 billion from the IMF, which her aides fear would rebound on Kiev&apos;s ability to pay for Russian gas. [ID:nLB138580] [ID:nLB394595]

The Fund refrained from releasing the funds -- part of a $16.4 billion programme to counter the economic crisis -- after Yushchenko signed the minimum wage law into force.

ELECTION FRONT-RUNNERS

Ex-Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, the biggest loser in a 2004 pro-western revolution, and Tymoshenko are front-runners in the race for president.

But the personal attack by Tymoshenko on Yushchenko confirmed that the run-up to the January election is likely to be dominated by sniping between the two erstwhile allies who once stood side by side in the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot;.

Tymoshenko painted a dark picture of the health threat which seemed certain to add to uncertainty among the 46 million population over its true extent.

Optimism that authorities could quickly get to grips with the epidemic had proved premature, she said. &quot;Today the epidemic is not relaxing its embrace,&quot; she said.

The outbreak of respiratory illness began in western Ukraine but is now spreading east, with cases appearing near the Russian border and in the south in Crimea.

On the streets of the capital, Kiev, many people are wearing face-masks. People are being turned away from some embassies and other public buildings if they are not wearing masks.

The World Health Organisation says it is assuming most cases of influenza in Ukraine had been caused by the H1N1 virus. WHO says the outbreak may indicate how the virus will develop in the northern hemisphere winter.

Yushchenko, who appears to have no chance of re-election according to popularity ratings, has accused Tymoshenko and Yanukovich of criminal negligence in the way they have handled the flu outbreak.

He said both leaders had been aware of the epidemic in the week they organised mass rallies for their own campaigns.

Tymoshenko on Wednesday renewed an accusation that Yushchenko could be preparing to introduce a state of emergency as a pretext for putting off the Jan. 17 election. (Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk, Natalya Zinets and Yuri Kulikov; Editing by Louise Ireland)</body>

    <body>* Flu deaths based on estimates

* Data take months to collect

* This pandemic spares the elderly -- to a point

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials are due to release new estimates of deaths from swine flu on Thursday, but the numbers will be just that -- a rough estimate.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization stopped trying to count actual cases months ago, once it became clear that H1N1 was a pandemic that would infect millions.

There are nowhere near enough diagnostic tests to give to everyone with flu-like symptoms to see if they really have swine flu, and autopsies have shown that some people who have died had H1N1 and no one even knew it.

So the death figures will be based on models, calculated by looking intensively at small groups of people, gathering data on overall reports of sickness and death, and reconciling the two.

This is also what happens every year with seasonal influenza, which WHO says kills 250,000 to 500,000 people a year globally and which CDC says kills 36,000 Americans in an average year.

Will this pandemic kill even more?

Not necessarily. Seasonal flu attacks about 20 percent of the population in an average year but it is the elderly who are the most likely to die. These patients often have other conditions and a flu infection can be the last straw that kills them.

H1N1 is hitting a younger population -- adults in their 20s and 30s and children. The latest counts from CDC showed that 1,000 have died so far, including 129 children.

The global count is more than 6,000, according to WHO.

It is possible that these younger patients may be more likely to survive their bout of flu, even if they have chronic conditions.

Doctors are comparing information about who is the most likely to die.

MEXICAN STUDY

A study in The Lancet medical journal released late on Wednesday shows that in Mexico, where the new flu appears to have spread first last March, young people were the most likely to be infected but elderly were most likely to die.

This study matches one published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association that showed 11 percent of Californians hospitalized for H1N1 died, but among people 50 and older, 18 to 20 percent who went to a hospital died.

A CDC estimate released last month suggested that up to 20,000 people were hospitalized with H1N1 through July and that 6 percent of hospitalized patients died, or about 1,300 people.

Seasonal flu has a death rate of less than 0.1 percent. The worst pandemic, such as the influenza pandemic of 1918, had a mortality rate of 2 percent or more.

The Mexican study also found that infants and people aged 39 years and under were the most likely to get infected, but that far fewer than 1 percent of these patients died.

Ten percent of patients over 70 who were treated in clinics died, they found.

They found that 4.5 percent of patients aged 50 to 59 died, but just 2.7 percent of those in their 40s and 2 percent of patients in their 30s.

These were all people who attended clinics that were part of the Mexican Institute for Social Security network, the Institute&apos;s Victor Borja-Aburto and colleagues reported, so milder cases for which patients did not seek treatment were not included in the analysis.

Mexicans who had been vaccinated for seasonal influenza had a 35 percent lower risk of getting H1N1, even though the seasonal flu vaccine offers no protection against the new virus.

Every day of delay in hospital admission after the fourth day of illness raised the risk of death by almost 20 percent, Borja-Aburto&apos;s team found.

The study shows hard hard it is to get a grip on flu deaths, as doctors cannot assess or count people who do not show up for treatment.

And numbers take months to collect. The latest Mexican data includes cases from April to July.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Desiree Rosado&apos;s daughter got the flu last month, she took a week off without pay; just an hour after finally returning to work Rosado had to leave again to take her feverish son home.

A bill proposed by Democratic Senator Chris Dodd would require U.S. employers to provide paid sick leave, helping workers like Rosado and hopefully slowing the spread of swine flu.

&quot;When I don&apos;t get paid, it wreaks havoc on our family budget,&quot; Rosado, an education assistant from Groton, Connecticut, told a Senate subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. &quot;Sometimes we end up having to borrow from our rent money that we set aside.&quot;

Health officials have been urging anyone with flu-like symptoms such as cough and fever to stay home to avoid spreading it.

&quot;Coming down with H1N1 means you have to make a choice either go into work sick and risk infecting co-workers, or stay at home and risk of course losing a day&apos;s pay,&quot; Dodd told a hearing of a health and labor subcommittee he chairs.

Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, invited to speak at the hearing, said 57 million Americans do not get paid leave, or even sometimes unpaid leave, to stay home sick or to care for sick relatives.

Dodd said three-quarters of them work in food and service industries and endanger not only co-workers, but the public.

&quot;Food service is not an industry where we want workers showing up with contagious viral infections,&quot; DeLauro added.

DeLauro in the House and Dodd in the Senate want to require that employers provide seven paid sick days for workers who have flu-like symptoms or whose children have them.

Republican Senator Mike Enzi said the proposal would hurt small businesses at a time when they need help creating new jobs, and might even end up costing jobs when the unemployment rate is 10.2 percent. &quot;This is not the time to compound problems,&quot; Enzi said.

The provision would also let workers take off with pay to care for a child whose school or child care facility has been closed because of flu. It would expire after two years.

&quot;Our system forces too many sick workers to go to work and too many parents to send sick children to school and daycare,&quot; said Seth Harris of the U.S. Department of Labor.

Dr Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that pandemic H1N1 was hitting children and young working-age adults far harder than regular seasonal flu does.

The H1N1 virus has infected millions globally, with more than 6,000 documented deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC estimates that more than 5 million Americans have been infected.

* Firm skipped last year&apos;s party amid financial crisis

NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - There will be no eggnog for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) this year.

Wall Street&apos;s dominant firm -- much-criticized for paying out-sized bonuses so soon after taking a government bailout -- is forgoing its Christmas party, spokeswoman Gia Moron said.

The bank also skipped its year-end party last year, as the financial sector was reeling from the demise of Lehman Brothers.

Goldman is weeks away from deciding how much to pay its top employees at year-end. It has reported more than $3 billion in profits in each of the past two quarters and so far this year has set aside nearly $17 billion for compensation and benefits.

The firm&apos;s public-relations struggles extend beyond the realm of pay. Last week, the firm was one of several banks to receive doses of H1N1 flu vaccines for distribution to at-risk employees.

* Yushchenko refuses to sign law for cash to fight epidemic

(Adds Tymoshenko on IMF)

By Richard Balmforth

KIEV, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine&apos;s president and prime minister hurled angry accusations at each other on Wednesday over ways of fighting an influenza epidemic, now a major factor in campaigning for a January election in which they are rivals.

A total of 189 people have died in the outbreak, the health ministry said, and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has cancelled political rallies and ordered schools shut to try to curb it.

The toll included 17 deaths from the H1N1 flu, First Deputy Health Minister Vasily Lazorishinets told journalists.

The health scare has caused panic across Ukraine and has become, like other hot issues such as contacts with the International Monetary Fund, a political football between President Viktor Yushchenko and Tymoshenko, both contenders in the Jan. 17 poll for president.

Weighing in against Yushchenko, Tymoshenko told ministers that the President, by failing to approve a law to release $125 million to fight the outbreak, was endangering human life.

&quot;Without the signing of this law, the government can not fight this epidemic today,&quot; she said.

&quot;The action of the President ... is an action today against Ukraine. The President will be responsible for every person who is ill today or dies.&quot;

Yushchenko, who in late October gave the go-ahead to rises in pensions and the minimum wage in defiance of the IMF and pleas by Tymoshenko, hit back immediately.

Signing a proposed law to release anti-flu funds would lead to new money being printed and a devaluation of the national currency, the hryvnia, he said.

&quot;I will not be the author of such a policy. I don&apos;t need to be blackmailed. I have the right of President. I am taking a decision (to veto the bill) and it&apos;s taken,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.

Implying further criticism of Yushchenko, Tymoshenko said Ukraine&apos;s economy will undergo an &quot;extremely difficult&quot; period without $3.8 billion from the IMF, which her aides fear would rebound on Kiev&apos;s ability to pay for Russian gas. [ID:nLB138580] [ID:nLB394595]

The Fund refrained from releasing the funds -- part of a $16.4 billion programme to counter the economic crisis -- after Yushchenko signed the minimum wage law into force.

ELECTION FRONT-RUNNERS

Ex-Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, the biggest loser in a 2004 pro-western revolution, and Tymoshenko are front-runners in the race for president.

But the personal attack by Tymoshenko on Yushchenko confirmed that the run-up to the January election is likely to be dominated by sniping between the two erstwhile allies who once stood side by side in the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot;.

Tymoshenko painted a dark picture of the health threat which seemed certain to add to uncertainty among the 46 million population over its true extent.

Optimism that authorities could quickly get to grips with the epidemic had proved premature, she said. &quot;Today the epidemic is not relaxing its embrace,&quot; she said.

The outbreak of respiratory illness began in western Ukraine but is now spreading east, with cases appearing near the Russian border and in the south in Crimea.

On the streets of the capital, Kiev, many people are wearing face-masks. People are being turned away from some embassies and other public buildings if they are not wearing masks.

The World Health Organisation says it is assuming most cases of influenza in Ukraine had been caused by the H1N1 virus. WHO says the outbreak may indicate how the virus will develop in the northern hemisphere winter.

Yushchenko, who appears to have no chance of re-election according to popularity ratings, has accused Tymoshenko and Yanukovich of criminal negligence in the way they have handled the flu outbreak.

He said both leaders had been aware of the epidemic in the week they organised mass rallies for their own campaigns.

Tymoshenko on Wednesday renewed an accusation that Yushchenko could be preparing to introduce a state of emergency as a pretext for putting off the Jan. 17 election. (Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk, Natalya Zinets and Yuri Kulikov; Editing by Louise Ireland)</body>

    <body>* Flu deaths based on estimates

* Data take months to collect

* This pandemic spares the elderly -- to a point

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials are due to release new estimates of deaths from swine flu on Thursday, but the numbers will be just that -- a rough estimate.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization stopped trying to count actual cases months ago, once it became clear that H1N1 was a pandemic that would infect millions.

There are nowhere near enough diagnostic tests to give to everyone with flu-like symptoms to see if they really have swine flu, and autopsies have shown that some people who have died had H1N1 and no one even knew it.

So the death figures will be based on models, calculated by looking intensively at small groups of people, gathering data on overall reports of sickness and death, and reconciling the two.

This is also what happens every year with seasonal influenza, which WHO says kills 250,000 to 500,000 people a year globally and which CDC says kills 36,000 Americans in an average year.

Will this pandemic kill even more?

Not necessarily. Seasonal flu attacks about 20 percent of the population in an average year but it is the elderly who are the most likely to die. These patients often have other conditions and a flu infection can be the last straw that kills them.

H1N1 is hitting a younger population -- adults in their 20s and 30s and children. The latest counts from CDC showed that 1,000 have died so far, including 129 children.

The global count is more than 6,000, according to WHO.

It is possible that these younger patients may be more likely to survive their bout of flu, even if they have chronic conditions.

Doctors are comparing information about who is the most likely to die.

MEXICAN STUDY

A study in The Lancet medical journal released late on Wednesday shows that in Mexico, where the new flu appears to have spread first last March, young people were the most likely to be infected but elderly were most likely to die.

This study matches one published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association that showed 11 percent of Californians hospitalized for H1N1 died, but among people 50 and older, 18 to 20 percent who went to a hospital died.

A CDC estimate released last month suggested that up to 20,000 people were hospitalized with H1N1 through July and that 6 percent of hospitalized patients died, or about 1,300 people.

Seasonal flu has a death rate of less than 0.1 percent. The worst pandemic, such as the influenza pandemic of 1918, had a mortality rate of 2 percent or more.

The Mexican study also found that infants and people aged 39 years and under were the most likely to get infected, but that far fewer than 1 percent of these patients died.

Ten percent of patients over 70 who were treated in clinics died, they found.

They found that 4.5 percent of patients aged 50 to 59 died, but just 2.7 percent of those in their 40s and 2 percent of patients in their 30s.

These were all people who attended clinics that were part of the Mexican Institute for Social Security network, the Institute&apos;s Victor Borja-Aburto and colleagues reported, so milder cases for which patients did not seek treatment were not included in the analysis.

Mexicans who had been vaccinated for seasonal influenza had a 35 percent lower risk of getting H1N1, even though the seasonal flu vaccine offers no protection against the new virus.

Every day of delay in hospital admission after the fourth day of illness raised the risk of death by almost 20 percent, Borja-Aburto&apos;s team found.

The study shows hard hard it is to get a grip on flu deaths, as doctors cannot assess or count people who do not show up for treatment.

And numbers take months to collect. The latest Mexican data includes cases from April to July.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Desiree Rosado&apos;s daughter got the flu last month, she took a week off without pay; just an hour after finally returning to work Rosado had to leave again to take her feverish son home.

A bill proposed by Democratic Senator Chris Dodd would require U.S. employers to provide paid sick leave, helping workers like Rosado and hopefully slowing the spread of swine flu.

&quot;When I don&apos;t get paid, it wreaks havoc on our family budget,&quot; Rosado, an education assistant from Groton, Connecticut, told a Senate subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. &quot;Sometimes we end up having to borrow from our rent money that we set aside.&quot;

Health officials have been urging anyone with flu-like symptoms such as cough and fever to stay home to avoid spreading it.

&quot;Coming down with H1N1 means you have to make a choice either go into work sick and risk infecting co-workers, or stay at home and risk of course losing a day&apos;s pay,&quot; Dodd told a hearing of a health and labor subcommittee he chairs.

Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, invited to speak at the hearing, said 57 million Americans do not get paid leave, or even sometimes unpaid leave, to stay home sick or to care for sick relatives.

Dodd said three-quarters of them work in food and service industries and endanger not only co-workers, but the public.

&quot;Food service is not an industry where we want workers showing up with contagious viral infections,&quot; DeLauro added.

DeLauro in the House and Dodd in the Senate want to require that employers provide seven paid sick days for workers who have flu-like symptoms or whose children have them.

Republican Senator Mike Enzi said the proposal would hurt small businesses at a time when they need help creating new jobs, and might even end up costing jobs when the unemployment rate is 10.2 percent. &quot;This is not the time to compound problems,&quot; Enzi said.

The provision would also let workers take off with pay to care for a child whose school or child care facility has been closed because of flu. It would expire after two years.

&quot;Our system forces too many sick workers to go to work and too many parents to send sick children to school and daycare,&quot; said Seth Harris of the U.S. Department of Labor.

Dr Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that pandemic H1N1 was hitting children and young working-age adults far harder than regular seasonal flu does.

The H1N1 virus has infected millions globally, with more than 6,000 documented deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC estimates that more than 5 million Americans have been infected.

    <body>LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) -  Britain&apos;s FTSE 100 .FTSE is seen opening
between 13 and 16 points higher or up 0.3 percent on Wednesday according to
financial bookmakers, reversing the previous session&apos;s losses, while investors
await a key inflation report from the Bank of England.  A rise in Asian stocks, after data showed China&apos;s factory output jumped to a
19-month high in October, is seen helping sustain some positive sentiment on the
FTSE 100 but gains on the index are expected to be muted following weakness on
Wall Street overnight. The FTSE 100 closed 0.1 percent lower on Tuesday, ending a four-session
winning run, as weakness in miners offset strength in banks after a strong
update from HSBC (HSBA.L). On the economic front, focus is likely to be on the Bank of England&apos;s
quarterly Inflation Report, due at 1030 GMT, which will contain the central
bank&apos;s latest growth and inflation forecasts.  Analysts will be looking for clues on the role played by these in its
decision to extend its quantitative easing programme by 25 billion pounds this
month.  Some labour market statistics are also set for release later in the session,
with British claimant count unemployment for October and the ILO jobless rate
for September both due at 0930 GMT.

    <title>Italian invents anti-swine flu holy water dispenser</title>

    <summary>... But fear of contracting the H1N1 virus has led many in Italy -- where some 15 people have died of swine flu -- not to dip their hands in the communal water font ...</summary>
    <body>ROME (Reuters) - An Italian inventor has combined faith and ingenuity to come up with a way to keep church traditions alive for the faithful without the fear of contracting swine flu -- an electronic holy water dispenser.

The terracotta dispenser, used in the northern town of Fornaci di Briosco, functions like an automatic soap dispenser in public washrooms -- a churchgoer waves his or her hand under a sensor and the machine spurts out holy water.

&quot;It has been a bit of a novelty. People initially were a bit shocked by this technological innovation but then they welcomed it with great enthusiasm and joy. The members of this parish have got used to it,&quot; said Father Pierangelo Motta.

Catholics entering and leaving churches usually dip their hands into fonts full of holy water -- which has been blessed by a priest -- and make the sign of the cross.

But fear of contracting the H1N1 virus has led many in Italy -- where some 15 people have died of swine flu -- not to dip their hands in the communal water font.

&quot;It&apos;s great,&quot; said worshipper Marta Caimm as she entered the church. &quot;Thanks to this we are not worried about catching swine flu. It is the right thing for the times,&quot; she said.

Luciano Marabese, who invented the dispenser, said he did so out of concern that fear of swine flu was eroding traditions.

And he is now blessing himself all the way to the bank.

&quot;After all the news that some churches, like Milan&apos;s cathedral, were suspending the use of holy water fonts as a measure against swine flu, demands for my invention shot to the stars. I have received orders from all over the world,&quot; he said.

    <body>* EPS C$0.79 vs consensus view C$0.80

* Revenue rises 7.9 pct to C$3.01 bln

* Shares down 1.6 percent at C$43.79 (Adds company comments)

By Scott Anderson

TORONTO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Shoppers Drug Mart (SC.TO), Canada&apos;s biggest pharmacy chain, reported a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by stronger sales of prescription drugs and beauty care products.

But its shares dropped 1.6 percent as investors worried about likely changes to rules on drug costs and prescription fees in the province of Ontario and the chance of similar changes in Alberta.

Ontario, Canada&apos;s most populous province, is reviewing the legislation and is expected to enact changes early next year.

&quot;It is a very complex discussion (in Ontario), obviously,&quot; chief executive Jurgen Schreiber told a conference call.

&quot;There is nothing to be speculated ... about any kind of impact. We are still together and negotiating and everything is in line with our expectations at this point in time.&quot;

Analysts see a hit to earnings between 20 Canadian cents and 35 Canadian cents a share if reforms go through.

&quot;The stock is going to remain range-bound until something comes out from Ontario on what is going to happen with this drug reform,&quot; said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones, in St. Louis, Missouri.

Shoppers shares, which have fallen about 7 percent in the past year, were down 1.6 percent at C$43.79 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Shoppers earned C$170.9 million ($163.5 million), or 79 Canadian cents a share, for the quarter to Oct 10, up from C$160.3 million, or 74 Canadian cents a share, in the year-before quarter.

Revenue climbed 7.9 percent to C$3.01 billion, with same-store sales rising 4.8 percent.

Analysts had expected, on average, earnings per share of 80 Canadian cents before items and revenue of C$3.00 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Prescription drug sales on a same-store basis gained 5.8 percent. Total prescription sales climbed 9.7 percent to C$1.48 billion, accounting for 49.1 percent of the sales mix, up from 48.3 percent for the same period last year.

Front-of-store sales, including things like cosmetics, candy and over-the-counter medications, jumped 6.2 percent to C$1.53 billion, excluding tobacco, on a same-store basis.

&quot;They continue to do a great job driving pharmacy sales and front-end sales continue to be strong,&quot; Yarbrough said. &quot;It&apos;s pretty impressive, compared with what else is going on out there in retail.&quot;

The results included only minimal sales from cold and flu remedies and hand sanitizers, but Schreiber expected this to pick up dramatically this quarter as the full effects of the H1N1 flu pandemic takes hold.

Shoppers opened or bought 37 drug stores in the quarter, including 15 relocations. At the end of the quarter, it had 1,282 stores -- 1,212 drug stores, 66 Shoppers Home Health Care stores, which supply medical equipment and devices, and four Murale stores, a luxury beauty brand launched last year.

    <body>* HSBC hits one-year high on strong outlook * SMIC jumps after CEO change, TSMC settlement * China slips, dragged down by banks on soft loan growth
 (Updates to midday) By Sui-Lee Wee and Claire Zhang HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks were
up 0.69 percent at the midday break on Wednesday, with index
heavyweight HSBC leading gains after a bullish outlook from the
bank eclipsed concerns about stretched market valuations
following a three-day rally. HSBC (0005.HK) rose as much as 4.7 percent to HK$92.85, its
highest in more than a year, before settling at HK$92.35, up
4.11 percent after the bank declared on Tuesday the first
improvement for three years in losses on U.S. consumer credit.
[ID:nLA635993] The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI rose 153.04 points to
22,421.20 at midday, heading for a fourth straight session of
gains. Turnover was slightly weaker at HK$38.8 billion ($5
billion), from midday Tuesday&apos;s HK$39.8 billion. The China Enterprise Index .HSCE of top locally listed
mainland Chinese stocks fell 0.21 percent to 13,339.24. &quot;Smart investors are taking profit,&quot; said Peter Lai, a
director at DBS Vickers. &quot;The room for any upside is limited.
It&apos;s the right time to quit when the index reaches 23,000.&quot; &quot;Any more negative U.S. economic indicators could trigger a
correction in the market,&quot; he said. SMIC (0981.HK), China&apos;s largest contract chipmaker, jumped
as much as 68.4 percent to HK$0.64, its highest since May 2008,
after the company announced a change of chief executive and the
settlement of a lawsuit with rival TSMC (2330.TW). At midday it
stood at HK$0.58, up 52.63 percent. Retail chain operator Artini China Co (0789.HK) rose as much
as 46.5 percent to a near five-month high of HK$1.26, before
settling at HK$1.16, after it said its jewellery-making
subsidiary had been granted a licence by the Asian arm of the
Walt Disney Company to use materials and trademarks of Disney
characters. China Energine International (1185.HK), which makes and
sells wind turbines, soared 19.1 percent to HK$1.12, its highest
in more than two years, after saying it would raise HK$266
million ($34.3 million) for working capital and to develop wind
energy projects in Inner Mongolia. At midday, the stock stood at
HK$1.05, up 11.7 percent. SHANGHAI SLIPS; BANKS FALL China&apos;s key stock index slipped 0.64 percent, with bank
shares soft after data showed that new lending slowed in
October, fuelling worries over market liquidity despite other
data pointing to brisk economic recovery. The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended the morning at
3,158.192 points, after rising on Tuesday for an eighth session
in a row to a three-month closing high. Losing Shanghai A shares outnumbered gainers by 579 to 285,
while turnover dipped to 75 billion yuan ($11 billion) from
Tuesday morning&apos;s 85 billion yuan. Wednesday&apos;s busy schedule of economic data releases showed
that China&apos;s export decline slowed in October, power generation
growth hit its fastest in 19 months, and industrial output
growth jumped to a 19-month high for the year to October,
underlining the economy&apos;s brisk recovery. But Chinese banks extended only 253.0 billion yuan in new
local-currency loans in October, lower than expected and down
sharply from 516.7 billion yuan in September. &quot;The strong economic data for October is generally in line
with investor expectations, but shrinking new lending raised
worries about market liquidity,&quot; said Chen Shaodan, senior
analyst at Stockfly Securities. She added that the market may be hit by profit-taking after
its extended rise, with the round figure at 3,000 points likely
to provide a floor. Bank shares were weak after the low loan data, with
Merchants Bank (600036.SS) losing 2.14 percent to 18.28 yuan. China&apos;s Baoshan Iron and Steel (600019.SS) was up 0.41
percent at 7.39 yuan after an industry source said on Wednesday
that it raised prices for its key steel products for December
sales by scrapping discounts implemented in November.
[ID:nSHA333474] Chongqing Changan Automobile (000625.SZ), one of the most
actively traded shares in Shenzhen, jumped by its 10 percent
daily limit to 15.42 yuan on resuming trade following news that
its parent company had agreed to acquire major auto-related
assets from Aviation Industry Corp of China. [ID:nSHA283110] The shares had been suspended from trade since Nov. 5,
pending a major announcement. The index was little changed
during that period. The listed company said, however, that it had no immediate
plan to acquire the assets from its parent. Yabao Pharmaceutical Group (600351.SS) raced up its 10
percent daily limit to 18.90 yuan after it said it was preparing
to manufacture a product that a government research body said
was effective against H1N1 flu.

 (Updates to close) By Sui-Lee Wee and Claire Zhang HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks rose
to their highest close in 15 months on Wednesday, with index
heavyweight HSBC leading gains after a bullish outlook from the
bank eclipsed concerns about stretched market valuations. HSBC (0005.HK) rose as much as 6.2 percent to HK$94.2, its
highest since October 2008, before settling at HK$94, up 6
percent, after the bank declared on Tuesday the first improvement
for three years in losses on U.S. consumer credit. [ID:nLA635993] The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI rose 1.61 percent, or
359.05 points, to 22,627.21, its fourth straight session of
gains. Turnover was HK$72.3 billion, from Tuesday&apos;s HK$70.5
billion. The China Enterprise Index .HSCE of top locally listed
mainland Chinese stocks rose 0.7 percent to 13,460.43. &quot;The market is still on the upturn,&quot; said Conita Hung, head
of equity research at Delta Asia Financial. &quot;Liquidity is
abundant and market sentiment is still very strong. The index
could likely test 23,000 within the next few days.&quot; But other brokers warned that the rally was not sustainable. &quot;The room for any upside is limited,&quot; said Peter Lai, a
director at DBS Vickers. &quot;It&apos;s the right time to quit when the
index reaches 23,000. Any more negative U.S. economic indicators
could trigger a correction in the market.&quot; SMIC (0981.HK), China&apos;s largest contract chipmaker, jumped as
much as 76.3 percent to HK$0.67, its highest since May 2008,
after the company announced a change of chief executive and the
settlement of a lawsuit with rival TSMC (2330.TW). At the close,
it stood at HK$0.66, up 74 percent. Bank of East Asia (0023.HK) rose 15.2 percent to HK$33.35 on
speculation that investment firm Guoco Group (0053.HK) may raise
its stake again in the bank, brokers said. Last week, Guoco
raised its stake in the lender to 8.01 percent from 7.99 percent. Retail chain operator Artini China Co (0789.HK) rose as much
as 46.5 percent to a near five-month high of HK$1.26, before
settling at HK$1.12, after it said its jewellery-making
subsidiary had been granted a licence by the Asian arm of the
Walt Disney Company to use materials and trademarks of Disney
characters. SHANGHAI DIPS China&apos;s key stock index edged down 0.1 percent, snapping an
eight-session rally, after weaker-than-expected data on new
lending for October offset news about a brisk economic recovery. The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended at 3,175.192
points after setting a three-month closing high on Tuesday. Gaining Shanghai A shares outnumbered losers by 501 to 380,
however, while turnover slipped to 144 billion yuan ($21.1
billion) from Tuesday&apos;s 163 billion yuan. Wednesday&apos;s busy schedule of economic data releases showed
that China&apos;s export decline slowed in October, power generation
growth hit its fastest in 19 months, and industrial output growth
jumped to a 19-month high for the year to October, underlining
the economy&apos;s brisk recovery. [ID:nPEK212006] But Chinese banks extended only 253.0 billion yuan in new
local-currency loans in October, below expectations and falling
sharply from 516.7 billion yuan in September to their lowest
monthly level this year. &quot;The strong economic data for October is generally in line
with investor expectations, but shrinking new lending raised
worries about market liquidity,&quot; said Chen Shaodan, senior
analyst at Stockfly Securities in Beijing. Bank shares were weak after the low loan data, with Merchants
Bank (600036.SS) losing 2.09 percent to 18.29 yuan. &quot;New lending is expected to be slower during the remaining
two months of the year, but the index may be stable as most
economic data are still positive,&quot; said Zhang Gang, strategist at
Central Securities in Shanghai. &quot;The banking sector&apos;s performance today was not that bad.
Underlying sentiment overall is still bullish.&quot; Among gainers, China&apos;s Baoshan Iron and Steel (600019.SS) was
up 0.95 percent at 7.43 yuan after an industry source said it
raised prices for its key steel products for December sales
compared with November tags. [ID:nSHA333474] Chongqing Changan Automobile (000625.SZ), one of the most

    <body>Nov 10 (Reuters) - Here are some details about measures
taken to fight the new H1N1 swine flu, a mixture of swine, bird
and human viruses and which has killed 6,500 people globally,
according to the latest European Centre for Disease prevention
and Control (ECDC) tallies. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared an H1N1
pandemic on June 11, indicating the first influenza pandemic
since 1968 was under way. The H1N1 pandemic flu virus could kill up to 40,000 people
across Europe and be followed by seasonal flu waves that could
kill the same number, European health experts said last week. The WHO has advised governments to prepare for a long-term
battle against the virus. Here are some details about those
measures taken around Europe. 
 * LATEST MEASURES BY GOVERNMENTS:
BRITAIN - Britain started a vaccination programme from Oct.
21 for high-risk patient groups including hospitalised patients,
frontline healthcare workers and young children with health
problems like asthma or other respiratory conditions. BULGARIA - Bulgaria declared national epidemics on Nov. 6
due to the quickly rising numbers of the infected people. The
health ministry has recommended organising public events be
limited. All schools across the country have been shut down for
a week (to Nov. 13) to prevent further spread of the virus. CROATIA - Says 50,000 additional doses of antiviral drugs
will be distributed to doctors. Vaccination started on Nov. 5
and the health authorities are urging all citizens to take part. FRANCE - France&apos;s mass vaccination campaign against H1N1 flu
got off to a shaky start, with low take-up among hospital staff
who were first in line and allegations that government advisers
received funding from pharmaceutical firms. Vaccinations began
on Oct. 20 for front-line hospital workers. A general
vaccination programme is to start on Nov. 12. -- France has ordered 94 million doses of anti-H1N1
vaccines, at a cost of 808 million euros ($1.2 billion), to
cover its population of 64 million. GERMANY - Germany began a campaign to vaccinate against H1N1
two weeks ago, but has been held back by a lack of doses. The
federal states have ordered 50 million doses which are gradually
being delivered.
HUNGARY - Hungary has started a school vaccination campaign
and public officials, including the health minister and the
prime minister, were vaccinated on TV. -- The country would be protected from a full-fledged
epidemic if 60 percent of the population was vaccinated,
authorities have said. The vaccine is produced locally by the
Hungarian pharmaceutical company Omninvest. IRELAND - Ireland launched a national vaccination campaign
from Nov. 2, with priority given to people considered at risk of
developing complications, including patients with a chronic
disease and pregnant women. NETHERLANDS - Health authorities started vaccinations of
risk groups on Nov. 9, widening initial plans to also include
children aged from 6 months up to and including four-year-olds. -- The government bought 34 million vaccine doses, enough to
supply the population twice over, but now expects to only use 11
million doses. It plans to sell the excess to other nations. ROMANIA - Romania&apos;s Supreme Defence Council has 1.3 million
doses of vaccine that could be used starting at the end of this
month. The interior ministry has intensified monitoring of
cross-border transit to identify potential cases of infections. SERBIA - A government work group is discussing whether to
recommend health minister Tomica Milosavljevic declare an
epidemic throughout Serbia or in individual regions. The health
and education ministries extended a school holiday that started
on Nov. 5 until Nov 16.  -- Media has said the government is likely to purchase a
total of 3 million vaccines from Novartis. If the deal happens,
the first batch of 500,000 doses should be delivered in December
and administered to priority groups (children, elderly, patients
with chronic diseases and health workers). SLOVENIA - Vaccination started Nov 2. Slovenia recorded its
first death from swine flu on November 3. SWITZERLAND -  Expects vaccination campaigns against H1N1
flu to start in mid-November. It has ordered 13 million doses
from GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. UKRAINE - Parliament has approved an additional $1 billion
for medicinal supplies. Extra supplies of swine flu medicine
have begun to arrive. -- The government has imposed measures such as a ban on
public meetings, including political rallies ahead of a January
presidential election, and closing schools for three weeks.
 * SOME NUMBERS: TOTAL REPORTED DEATHS: 6,508* REGIONAL BREAKDOWN:                       AREA                   TOTAL DEATHS: EU AND EFTA COUNTRIES                                   414 OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES &amp; CENTRAL ASIA                  34 MEDITERRANEAN AND MIDDLE-EAST                           278 AFRICA                                                  108 NORTH AMERICA                                         1,517 CENTRAL AMERICA &amp; CARIBBEAN                            168 SOUTH AMERICA                                        2,742 NORTH-EAST &amp; SOUTH ASIA                                671 SOUTH-EAST ASIA                                        364 AUSTRALIA &amp; PACIFIC                                    212 * NOTE: Deaths reported to ECDC  Sources: Reuters/ECDC:

GENEVA, Nov 10 (Reuters) - British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) has agreed to donate 50 million doses of pandemic H1N1 vaccine to the World Health Organisation for use in developing countries in coming months, the WHO said on Tuesday.

GSK, which makes the Pandemrix H1N1 vaccine being used in pandemic vaccination programmes in Britain and other European countries, said it expected to prepare the first shipments of vaccine to the WHO by the end of November.

&quot;We expect to start receiving it at the end of the month or early December and that the full 50 million will come by the end of spring,&quot; WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told a news briefing.

&quot;We hope it is the first of many donations,&quot; he added.

The WHO said it has a list of 95 developing countries eligible to receive donated vaccines, and aimed to secure enough vaccines to cover 10 percent of their populations. Health care workers are deemed top priority for the first batches.

&quot;This is a real gesture of global solidarity towards those who would not be otherwise able to have access to the vaccine,&quot; WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in a statement. &quot;WHO will now work to see that these vaccines are distributed to those who need them.&quot;

GSK and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among some 25 companies producing pandemic vaccine and other drugmakers including Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding (ROG.VX) are making antivirals for use as a frontline H1N1 drug.

The WHO has repeatedly said the H1N1 vaccines being produced are safe. Hartl told journalists in Geneva that young children, because they are so vulnerable to extreme symptoms from the pandemic flu, ought to be protected.

&quot;The trade-off or the balance between risk and benefit for using an H1N1 vaccine, we believe, falls for the moment very much on the side of benefit,&quot; the spokesman said.

Staff at the WHO&apos;s Geneva headquarters have not so far been vaccinated for H1N1 in an organised campaign, though medical personnel going on mission would be seen as a priority to get the protection, he said.

GENEVA, Nov 10 (Reuters) - British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) has agreed to donate 50 million doses of pandemic H1N1 vaccine to the World Health Organisation for use in developing countries in coming months, the WHO said on Tuesday.

GSK, which makes the Pandemrix H1N1 vaccine being used in pandemic vaccination programmes in Britain and other European countries, said it expected to prepare the first shipments of vaccine to the WHO by the end of November.

By Ros Krasny

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov 10 (Reuters) - Production of H1N1 swine flu vaccine at two U.S. facilities is &quot;working optimally&quot; with output on the rise, the chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) said on Tuesday.

The French pharmaceutical giant had shipped 14 million doses by the end of October and expects to have shipped some 75 million doses to the U.S. market by late December, CEO Christopher Viehbacher told reporters at a company-sponsored biotech event in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

&quot;We&apos;re probably the only company that is producing reliably right now,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re pretty happy with production; it takes a while to get the thing up and running.&quot;

Production of the vaccine runs on roughly a 15-week cycle. While output has been coming up to speed and availability of the vaccine has been scarce in many areas, instances of swine flu in the United States have been spreading.

Sanofi-Aventis&apos; facilities in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, are the only sites producing the H1N1 vaccine in the United States,and are now using some 300,000 eggs a day, Viehbacher said.

Yields for H1N1 vaccine production are approaching levels typical of seasonal flu vaccine, which can also vary from strain to strain, he said.

Sanofi-Aventis has a 40-percent market share globally for the seasonal flu vaccine. Production of seasonal flu vaccine has been wrapped up at this point, although packaging the vaccine has been under &quot;some strain,&quot; Viehbacher said,

Viehbacher said the company should get EU approval &quot;fairly shortly&quot; to sell the Panenza vaccine for H1N1, which is similar to the U.S. variety, in four European countries.

Approval for the Humenza adjuvanted variety for broader distribution would probably come in mid-December, he said.

STEPPING BACK FROM THE PATENT CLIFF

In a presentation, Viehbacher said the challenge for large pharmaceutical companies is to avoid going over the &quot;patent cliff&quot; when blockbuster drugs go off-patent and are exposed to generic competition for the first time. The &quot;cliff&quot; looms for much of the industry in 2012 to 2014, he said.

Sanofi&apos;s future efforts will include a strong focus on emerging markets and on animal health, which in turn circles back to a rising standard of living and changing diet in developing countries.

&quot;The single biggest healthcare opportunity there is, is vaccines in the southern hemisphere,&quot; Viehbacher said. &quot;How do we reach the next billion customers?&quot; (Editing by Maureen Bavdek)</body>

* Expert says weakness of primary care in U.S. is problem

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Compared to the problems dogging health departments in the United States, Europe&apos;s battle to vaccinate the vulnerable against pandemic H1N1 swine flu appears to be going relatively smoothly -- so far.

H1N1 vaccination programmes in Britain and other European countries are off to a slow start, but experts say the infrastructure of their national health systems allows officials to coordinate and manage them better than in the United States.

Dr. Steve Field, president of Britain&apos;s Royal College of General Physicians, has just returned from the United States where he described &quot;lines of people waiting for their flu jabs&quot;.

&quot;The thing here is that we are a smaller country, and our health system is more homogenous, and primary care is very strong -- that allows us to prioritise people and to call and recall them when we need to,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.

In most countries in western Europe swine flu vaccines made by drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Roche AG (ROG.VX), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Novartis (NOVN.VX) and others are being offered by invitation to those at highest risk of complications.

In Britain, the rollout of vaccines started on Oct. 21 and it is likely to be several weeks before all doctors have supplies at the ready, but because of the invitation-only approach, there are no queues of angry patients demanding shots.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said British doctors were being advised to &quot;wait to receive the vaccine before inviting patients in&quot; and added: &quot;This can in many cases be done by telephone, text, or email.&quot;

Field said he expected an equally orderly picture to emerge in Denmark and the Netherlands -- which started vaccinations of risk groups on Monday -- where family doctors have similarly good contacts and data on their patients.

More than 4OO deaths from H1N1 swine flu have been recorded in Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control&apos;s latest data puts the global death toll at 6,508.

An international survey of primary care doctors last week showed that while the United States spends more than twice as much as other developed nations on healthcare, it lags behind in key measures of quality and has a weak primary care system. [ID:nN0565165]

It also showed that electronic medical records are nearly universal in the Netherlands, Britain, Italy, Norway and Sweden.

&quot;There is lots of evidence to suggest that if you have strong primary care, you have much better preventative care, because you have lists of patients to work with and you can ring them or email them if they don&apos;t turn up,&quot; Field said.

In the United States the slow supply of H1N1 vaccines has piled pressure on state and city health departments trying to get immunizations to those who need and want them.

Children, pregnant women, healthcare workers and those with health problems are supposed to get the vaccine first, but New York City health officials came under fire last week for distributing vaccines to employers such as banks, creating the perception that healthy people were jumping the queue.

&quot;In the United States it&apos;s sort of a first come, first served, and there&apos;s a little bit of panic going on,&quot; Field said. &quot;Here, we can control the panic, because we can prioritise.&quot; (For a FACTBOX on the latest figures and measures against H1N1, please click on [ID:nLA314342] (Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Desiree Rosado&apos;s daughter got the flu last month, she took a week off without pay; just an hour after finally returning to work Rosado had to leave again to take her feverish son home.

A bill proposed by Democratic Senator Chris Dodd would require U.S. employers to provide paid sick leave, helping workers like Rosado and hopefully slowing the spread of swine flu.

&quot;When I don&apos;t get paid, it wreaks havoc on our family budget,&quot; Rosado, an education assistant from Groton, Connecticut, told a Senate subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. &quot;Sometimes we end up having to borrow from our rent money that we set aside.&quot;

Health officials have been urging anyone with flu-like symptoms such as cough and fever to stay home to avoid spreading it.

&quot;Coming down with H1N1 means you have to make a choice either go into work sick and risk infecting co-workers, or stay at home and risk of course losing a day&apos;s pay,&quot; Dodd told a hearing of a health and labor subcommittee he chairs.

Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, invited to speak at the hearing, said 57 million Americans do not get paid leave, or even sometimes unpaid leave, to stay home sick or to care for sick relatives.

Dodd said three-quarters of them work in food and service industries and endanger not only co-workers, but the public.

&quot;Food service is not an industry where we want workers showing up with contagious viral infections,&quot; DeLauro added.

DeLauro in the House and Dodd in the Senate want to require that employers provide seven paid sick days for workers who have flu-like symptoms or whose children have them.

Republican Senator Mike Enzi said the proposal would hurt small businesses at a time when they need help creating new jobs, and might even end up costing jobs when the unemployment rate is 10.2 percent. &quot;This is not the time to compound problems,&quot; Enzi said.

The provision would also let workers take off with pay to care for a child whose school or child care facility has been closed because of flu. It would expire after two years.

&quot;Our system forces too many sick workers to go to work and too many parents to send sick children to school and daycare,&quot; said Seth Harris of the U.S. Department of Labor.

Dr Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that pandemic H1N1 was hitting children and young working-age adults far harder than regular seasonal flu does.

The H1N1 virus has infected millions globally, with more than 6,000 documented deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC estimates that more than 5 million Americans have been infected.

JEDDAH, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Standing in the middle of a long queue at Jeddah airport, Mahdi Sharif is one of millions of Muslims waiting to enter Saudi Arabia to start the annual haj pilgrimage despite a global outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus.

Little fazed by the spread of the virus, Sharif, who has been waiting for two years to be selected from a raffle of 5,000 Kurdish Iraqis to visit Mecca, wears a protection mask but never thought for a second of delaying his pilgrimage.

&quot;This year I was chosen so I came, I could not say no. The happiness of being chosen is stronger than fear (of illness),&quot; said Sharif in a muffled voice through his medical mask.

Since the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the virus a pandemic in June, experts feared that the 3 million pilgrims, from over 160 countries, congregating around Mecca&apos;s holy sites this month will aid in the transmission of the virus, initiate waves of outbreaks worldwide and strain healthcare systems.

In June, the Saudi authorities advised persons over 65 and under 12, as well as people suffering from terminal illness, and pregnant women, to postpone their pilgrimage. Several Muslim countries also imposed similar restrictions on their pilgrims and Tunisia barred its citizens from this year&apos;s ritual.

About 580,000 pilgrims have so far arrived to the Western region of Saudi Arabia, site of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina, in preparation for the pilgrimage that will start on November 26.

Saudi authorities have tightened health measures at the airports and sea port where pilgrims arrive.

At Jeddah airport the Health Ministry increased medical staff by 22 percent from the previous year to 568 that includes doctors, nurses, lab technicians and pharmacists.

Upon arrival, pilgrims pass by thermal censors installed at the end of each jetway to detect their temperature. If a pilgrim was found to have a temperature above 38 degrees, an alarm will sound and the pilgrim will be taken aside for examination.

&quot;If the fever is accompanied by symptoms of the flu ... they will take a swab and confirm the case either negative or positive. If found positive, they will keep him under observation for five days and give him treatment,&quot; said Mohamed Al-Harti, health manager at King Abdulaziz airport.

King Saud Hospital in Jeddah, created especially to cater for H1N1 cases during the haj, currently has up to 300 beds but officials say that no confirmed cases have been recorded yet.

Health authorities have stopped announcing the number of people who have caught the virus but there are 66 deaths related to the virus in Saudi Arabia so far.

This month, the authorities approved a GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s vaccine for the H1N1 virus and launched a national vaccination campaign among its population of nearly 25 million people.

Google has launched a feature in its Maps Web site that lets U.S. residents find nearby locations for getting seasonal and H1N1 flu shots, the company announced Tuesday.

Google previously launched a site where people can monitor current flu-infection levels in the U.S. and abroad.

In launching the flu-shot finder, Google warned that the service doesn&apos;t yet have comprehensive data on all providers because it is still gathering that information.

In addition, Google Maps won&apos;t tell people whether a particular provider has run out of vaccines, a big issue right now with the H1N1 shot, whose production isn&apos;t keeping up with demand. Thus, people are advised to call the providers before heading to their location.</body>

By Randall Palmer

OTTAWA, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Hurt by a poor showing in special elections on Monday, Canada&apos;s opposition Liberal Party acknowledged on Tuesday it has a steep hill to climb to regain popular support.

The Liberals, the biggest opposition party and the most successful political party in Canadian history, came in in third place in all four of Monday&apos;s elections, held to fill vacant seats in the federal Parliament.

The Liberals decided in September to try to bring down the minority Conservative government in Parliament and force a general election, but their dismal showing in Monday&apos;s by-elections, and an unexpected pickup in support for the Conservatives in the French-speaking province of Quebec, have prompted some soul-searching.

&quot;The by-election results last night show that we have a lot of work ahead of us,&quot; said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, a former Harvard don who shook up his inner circle this month in a bid to rebuild momentum.

&quot;Our job in the months ahead is to earn the confidence and support of Canadians.&quot;

The governing party often loses ground in by-elections but the Conservatives added two seats on Monday -- including a surprise win in Quebec, where until recently they had been losing ground.

The Quebec win came at the expense of the Bloc Quebecois, which advocates independence for the province and retains a majority of the Quebec seats.

Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe said his party would dissect the results but said the loss may have been the result of voter unhappiness that the Bloc legislator who had held the seat had stepped down so soon after the October 2008 general election.

The Liberals had not been expected to win any of the by-elections but they had been expected to put in a stronger showing. They had not held any of the four seats before the Monday votes.

The results showed pressure on the centrist Liberals from smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party, which held on to one seat in British Columbia and came second in two of the other contests.

&quot;One gold and two silver -- I&apos;m happy with that,&quot; NDP spokesman Karl Belanger said.

Liberal support across Canada started falling in September when the party decided to try to trigger an election just a year after the last one, in the middle of a fragile economic recovery.

The Liberals have charged over the last two months that the government was mishandling vaccination plans for the H1N1 flu and was being unfair in its distribution of funds for economic stimulus projects.

&quot;The results were a failure for Michael Ignatieff, and a repudiation of his strategy of playing politics with H1N1,&quot; said Dimitri Soudas, a spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

The Liberals have said they will no longer move motions of non-confidence in the government in Parliament but have avoided answering whether they will still always vote against the Conservatives when confidence tests arise, such as parliamentary votes on budgetary matters.

By Ben Hirschler

NEW YORK (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc&apos;s (AZN.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) board will consider in January whether to reintroduce share buybacks after &quot;an unusually good&quot; 2009, during which it slashed debt, the drugmaker&apos;s chief executive said on Tuesday.

David Brennan wants to retain strategic flexibility to do deals, but he told the Reuters Health Summit that partnerships on experimental drugs and technologies were his prime focus and a major acquisition of more than $10 billion was unlikely.

Thanks in part to one-off gains from the sale of H1N1 swine flu vaccine and the delayed entry of generic competition to heart drug Toprol XL, AstraZeneca had &quot;got ahead of where we thought we would be from a cash perspective,&quot; he said.

That has allowed the group to pay down debt from the $15.6 billion acquisition of MedImmune in 2007 faster than expected, fueling speculation the company might soon restart share buybacks, which were halted in October 2008.

&quot;We will decide again in January when we have a chance to look at the budget, the opportunities for the business in 2010, what will be the challenges that we face,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.

&quot;Certainly dividends, servicing the debt and being positioned to invest in the business are the first three priorities. And then a share repurchase program follows that one.&quot;

LESS DEBT

Strong cash-flows have reduced net debt by $3.98 billion since the end of 2008 to $3.19 billion at the end of the third quarter, and some industry analysts expect it to be only a little over $1 billion by the end of the year.

&quot;We&apos;re now getting close to getting to zero net debt ... we&apos;re way ahead of the targets we set for ourselves,&quot; Brennan said.

AstraZeneca still faces major challenges, since it has one of the largest patent expiry exposures among major drugmakers, with top medicines, including popular heartburn treatment Nexium and Seroquel for schizophrenia, set to lose exclusivity.

It also faces a patent challenge from generic drugmakers to its new blockbuster cholesterol drug Crestor, which could prematurely cut off revenues from a key driver if successful.

A summary judgment hearing in that case is due to be held in a Delaware court on November 16, though Brennan said it would likely be several weeks before a ruling was handed down.

He said the Crestor patent was &quot;solid&quot; and AstraZeneca would defend it &quot;very aggressively.&quot;

Given the looming &quot;cliff&quot; of patent losses, investors expect AstraZeneca to ramp up its efforts to boost its pipeline of new drugs.

The Anglo-Swedish company has had more success recently in getting its new drugs to market and has also had some promising clinical results. But Brennan said he would continue to look for additional products to buy in, but on a smaller scale than MedImmune.  Continued...

    <body>* Refiners soar after China&apos;s fuel price hike * BYD falls after charger recall * China&apos;s health-related stocks up on pandemic flu warning (Updates to midday) By Sui-Lee Wee and Claire Zhang HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks rose
to their highest levels in more than two weeks on Tuesday, with
investors taking heart from a rally on Wall Street and a pledge
by the Group of 20 to keep aid flowing to the world economy. The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI rose 187.91 points to
22,395.46 at midday, heading for its third straight session of
gains. Brokers said the rally was likely to continue as risk
appetite strengthened after the agreement by G20 finance
ministers and central bankers to keep economic stimulus measures
in place boosted hopes for prolonged low interest rates. &quot;Overall, the market sentiment remains buoyant,&quot; said Ben
Kwong, chief operating officer of KGI Asia. &quot;Investors are
confident that there&apos;ll be no more tightening by central
governments and the U.S. dollar remains weak too, which is
boosting commodity-related stocks.&quot; &quot;The liquidity remains abundant locally and that would limit
the downside in the short term,&quot; he said. Kwong expects Hong Kong&apos;s stock index to breach 23,000 within
the next few days. Turnover was at HK$39.8 billion ($5.14 billion), up from
midday Monday&apos;s HK$33.96 billion. The China Enterprise Index .HSCE of top locally listed
mainland Chinese stocks rose 0.97 percent to 13,447.53. Shares in Sinopec Corp, (0386.HK), Asia&apos;s top oil refiner,
rose as much as 2.6 percent to a three-week high of HK$7 after
China raised fuel prices, boosting the profit outlook for the
country&apos;s refiners. PetroChina (0857.HK) (601857.SS) (PTR.N), China&apos;s No. 2
refiner, gained 2 percent to a two-week high of HK$10.24. The U.S. dollar briefly fell to a 15-month low overnight,
bolstering stocks pegged to commodities such as gold. Sino Gold
Mining (1862.HK) rose 5.7 percent to HK$54.65. Shares in BYD Electronic (0285.HK), the battery making arm of
BYD Co (1211.HK), fell 5.1 after Nokia (NOK1V.HE) said it would
replace 14 million cellphone chargers made by the Chinese
company. [ID:nHKG280586]. Auto stocks surged after China said its passenger cars sales
in October surged 76 percent from a year earlier, extending the
explosive growth in recent months as government incentive
policies continued to lure customers. [ID:nSHA159082]. Qingling Motors (1122.HK) rose 12.9 percent and Brilliance
China (1114.HK) climbed 8 percent. SHANGHAI RISES; BANKS, HEALTH STOCKS UP China&apos;s key stock index rose 0.30 percent, up for an eighth
session, on hopes for strong October economic data due for
release on Wednesday. The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended the morning at
3,185.001 points, after setting a new three-month intraday high
of 3,211.105. Losing Shanghai A shares outnumbered gainers by 457 to 414,
with turnover remaining active at 85 billion yuan ($12 billion),
unchanged from Monday morning. &quot;Investors remain cautious after recent gains, but stock
valuations are relatively reasonable, backed by rising earnings.
The index has a chance to rise higher,&quot; said Chen Jinren, analyst
at Huatai Securities. The 14-day Relative Strength Index rose to 65, edging close
to the 70 level, which indicates that stocks are overbought. Bank shares were firmer, with China Minsheng Banking Corp
(600016.SS) edging up 0.25 percent to 8.13 yuan after saying on
Tuesday that its failed investment in U.S. lender UCBH Holdings
Inc UCBH.O would have a limited impact on its business.
[ID:nSHA279897] Health-related shares rose after the World Health
Organisation said over the weekend that the H1N1 flu virus was on

 (Updates to close) By Sui-Lee Wee and Claire Zhang HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks rose
to a two-week closing high on Tuesday, with investors taking
heart from a rally on Wall Street and a pledge by the Group of 20
to keep aid flowing to the world economy. But the index trimmed earlier strong gains in afternoon trade
as investors took profit following a three-day rally. The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI rose 60.61 points to
22,268.16. Although brokers said the rally was likely to continue on
strengthening risk appetite, they said any upside on the index
would be limited as valuations look stretched. &quot;Valuations are not attractive at all,&quot; said Castor Pang,

By Frank Jack Daniel

PUERTO AYACUCHO, Venezuela, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A potentially devastating outbreak of swine flu among the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela&apos;s Amazon rain forest appears to be contained for now after a rapid medical response in the remote zone.

Considered the largest isolated Amazon tribe, with a population of about 30,000, the Yanomami had limited contact with the outside world until 50 years ago. Illnesses brought by gold miners have hit them hard in the past.

Symptoms of swine flu -- possibly spread by outsiders at a government-organized event in mid-October -- showed up in more than 1,000 Yanomami, local health officials said. Six deaths are being investigated for possible links to the H1N1 virus.

Neris Villalobos, chief epidemiologist for Amazonas state, said the initial outbreak peaked at the end of October and the number of new cases has declined sharply.

&quot;The action taken has been successful, although we cannot yet say that the situation is over,&quot; Villalobos told Reuters in Puerto Ayacucho, capital of Amazonas.

She said medical practitioners had yet to visit far-flung villages to check for possible undetected cases. Medics have given the flu drug Tamiflu, made by Swiss-based Roche (ROG.VX), to more than 2,000 villagers in the tribal area, which is accessible only by river or aircraft.

Many of the medics are Cuban or Cuban-trained and form part of President Hugo Chavez&apos;s nationwide drive to put doctors in remote communities.

&quot;If they had not taken the measures in a timely fashion, this would have been a truly enormous epidemic,&quot; said Cuban doctor Giovanni Castellano.

CHANGING WAYS

About 30 doctors are now permanently stationed on the Venezuelan side of the Yanomami region, which straddles the Brazilian border and is roughly the size of Greece.

Illegal mining in the region, especially on the Brazilian side, introduced diseases among the tribe in the 1980s that killed about 20 percent of them.

Tribe members typically live in circular communal huts built around a courtyard. The men hunt for food and the women plant different crops in clearings.

The H1N1 virus appears to have begun among the Yanomami during a meeting organized by government officials to mark the Oct. 12 anniversary of the arrival in the Americas of explorer Christopher Columbus, medics said.

U.K.-based Indian rights group Survival International said it was doubtful the outbreak had been contained.

&quot;Given the nature of how it is incubated and spread, and its unpredictability, I just don&apos;t think one can say that with any certainty,&quot; said Survival spokeswoman Fiona Watson.

She said the Yanomamis&apos; vulnerability to disease meant the reserve should have been sealed to all but health teams after the virus first spread globally earlier this year.

Unprecedented attention from the socialist Chavez government is bringing rapid change to the tribe.

Literacy projects, agricultural training and government jobs are now part of daily life for many of the Indians.

&quot;The state is fomenting cultural changes in these people. It&apos;s not new but it&apos;s happening faster. The most negative aspect is politicization,&quot; said one local expert on Yanomami health who asked not to be named.

Yanomami Francisco Sutti, 52 -- who ferries doctors between villages along the maze of waterways in the reserve -- said many jobs were handed out by politicians.

&quot;The doctors have been good to me, but the politicians are always fighting, and people sometimes lose their jobs if they speak to someone from another party,&quot; he said.

* Six deaths investigated as officials monitor situation

By Frank Jack Daniel

PUERTO AYACUCHO, Venezuela, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A potentially devastating outbreak of swine flu among the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela&apos;s Amazon rainforest appears to be contained after a rapid medical response in the isolated zone.

Considered to be the largest isolated Amazon tribe, with a population of about 30,000, the semi-nomadic Yanomami had limited contact with the outside world until 50 years ago.

Since the 1960s, the Yanomami population has been hard hit by illnesses brought by gold miners and other outsiders.

The deaths of six Yanomami are being investigated for possible links to the H1N1 virus. But Neris Villalobos, chief epidemiologist for the state of Amazonas, said the initial outbreak peaked at the end of October and was waning.

Possibly spread by outsiders at a government-organized event last month, flu symptoms showed up in more than 1,000 Yanomami, local health officials said. The number of new cases has declined sharply since then.

&quot;The action taken has been successful, although we cannot yet say that the situation is over,&quot; Villalobos told Reuters in Puerto Ayacucho, capital of the local Amazonas region.

She said medics still needed to visit far-flung villages to check for any possible undetected cases of the disease. Medics have given Swiss drug maker Roche&apos;s (ROG.VX) flu drug Tamiflu to more than 2,000 villagers in the tribal area, accessible only by river or air.

Socialist President Hugo Chavez&apos;s government in recent years has expanded health services to the Yanomami. About 30 doctors are now permanently stationed on the Venezuelan side of the Yanomami region, which straddles the Brazilian border and is about as large as Greece.

Many are Cubans who form part of Chavez&apos;s popular nationwide drive to put doctors in remote communities.

During the outbreak, Cuban-trained Venezuelan doctors were flown in to bolster care. &quot;If they had not taken the measures in a timely fashion, this would have been a truly enormous epidemic,&quot; said Cuban doctor Giovanni Castellano.

Illegal gold mining in the region, especially on the Brazilian side of the border, spread disease such as malaria among the tribe in the 1980s and caused the deaths of about 20 percent of the population in a seven-year period.

Tribe members typically live in circular communal huts built around a courtyard. The men hunt for food and the women plant dozens of different crops in clearings. Every few years they move to new forest areas to let land regenerate.

The H1N1 virus appears to have entered the Yanomami&apos;s rainforest home during a meeting organized by government officials to mark the Oct. 12 anniversary of the arrival in the Americas of explorer Christopher Columbus, medics said.

By Frank Jack Daniel

PUERTO AYACUCHO, Venezuela, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A potentially devastating outbreak of swine flu among the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela&apos;s Amazon rain forest appears to be contained for now after a rapid medical response in the remote zone.

Considered the largest isolated Amazon tribe, with a population of about 30,000, the Yanomami had limited contact with the outside world until 50 years ago. Illnesses brought by gold miners have hit them hard in the past.

Symptoms of swine flu -- possibly spread by outsiders at a government-organized event in mid-October -- showed up in more than 1,000 Yanomami, local health officials said. Six deaths are being investigated for possible links to the H1N1 virus.

Neris Villalobos, chief epidemiologist for Amazonas state, said the initial outbreak peaked at the end of October and the number of new cases has declined sharply.

&quot;The action taken has been successful, although we cannot yet say that the situation is over,&quot; Villalobos told Reuters in Puerto Ayacucho, capital of Amazonas.

She said medical practitioners had yet to visit far-flung villages to check for possible undetected cases. Medics have given the flu drug Tamiflu, made by Swiss-based Roche (ROG.VX), to more than 2,000 villagers in the tribal area, which is accessible only by river or aircraft.

Many of the medics are Cuban or Cuban-trained and form part of President Hugo Chavez&apos;s nationwide drive to put doctors in remote communities.

&quot;If they had not taken the measures in a timely fashion, this would have been a truly enormous epidemic,&quot; said Cuban doctor Giovanni Castellano.

CHANGING WAYS

About 30 doctors are now permanently stationed on the Venezuelan side of the Yanomami region, which straddles the Brazilian border and is roughly the size of Greece.

Illegal mining in the region, especially on the Brazilian side, introduced diseases among the tribe in the 1980s that killed about 20 percent of them.

Tribe members typically live in circular communal huts built around a courtyard. The men hunt for food and the women plant different crops in clearings.

The H1N1 virus appears to have begun among the Yanomami during a meeting organized by government officials to mark the Oct. 12 anniversary of the arrival in the Americas of explorer Christopher Columbus, medics said.

U.K.-based Indian rights group Survival International said it was doubtful the outbreak had been contained.

&quot;Given the nature of how it is incubated and spread, and its unpredictability, I just don&apos;t think one can say that with any certainty,&quot; said Survival spokeswoman Fiona Watson.

She said the Yanomamis&apos; vulnerability to disease meant the reserve should have been sealed to all but health teams after the virus first spread globally earlier this year.

Unprecedented attention from the socialist Chavez government is bringing rapid change to the tribe.

Literacy projects, agricultural training and government jobs are now part of daily life for many of the Indians.

&quot;The state is fomenting cultural changes in these people. It&apos;s not new but it&apos;s happening faster. The most negative aspect is politicization,&quot; said one local expert on Yanomami health who asked not to be named.

Yanomami Francisco Sutti, 52 -- who ferries doctors between villages along the maze of waterways in the reserve -- said many jobs were handed out by politicians.

&quot;The doctors have been good to me, but the politicians are always fighting, and people sometimes lose their jobs if they speak to someone from another party,&quot; he said.

* Lower fuel costs, won help; cargo demand still weak

* Shares up 2.3 pct vs KOSPI&apos;s 0.8 pct gain (Adds details, analyst comment)

SEOUL, Nov 10 (Reuters) - South Korea&apos;s top airline Korean Air Co posted its second straight quarterly net profit on Tuesday thanks to lower fuel costs and the strengthening won KRW=, and cautiously forecasted further recovery next year.

Airlines around the world have been hit by soft travel demand and low fares after the global financial crisis and more recent worries over the H1N1 flu pandemic, but are seeing a stabilising trend.

Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI), the world&apos;s largest airline by market value, is set to report its quarterly results later on Tuesday.

&quot;Both passenger and cargo businesses showed improvement in October. Concerns over the H1N1 flu are expected to cool down after hitting a peak likely in November,&quot; said Lawrence Kim, an analyst at Woori Investment &amp; Securities.

Korean Air (003490.KS) shares rose 2.3 percent as of 0253 GMT, leading the wider market&apos;s 0.8 percent gain.

Korean Air, the world&apos;s biggest air cargo carrier, reported a net profit of 264 billion won ($228.7 million) for the third quarter, slightly below a consensus forecast of 279.4 billion won from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The result improved sharply from a 684.1 billion won net loss a year earlier and a 78.5 billion won profit in the April-June quarter.

It also swung to an operating profit of 100.1 billion won, against losses a year earlier and in the previous quarter and below a consensus forecast of 144.4 billion won.

&quot;As oil prices continue to stabilise and the won strengthens further, the airline expects to deliver better performance in the coming year,&quot; the company said in a statement.

It pays for fuel and aircraft lease in dollars.

In the third quarter, fuel costs shrank 40 percent from a year earlier while an improvement in international passenger business also helped. JET-SIN

But its cargo business continued to suffer on falling global demand, although a slight recovery was observed on a month-to-month basis, Korean Air said.

Its stock rose 20 percent so far this year through Monday, while the broader market gained 40 percent. ($1=1154.1 Won) (Reporting by Shin Jieun and Rhee So-eui; Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)</body>

    <body>* HK stocks up on abundant liquidity; finance leads * Lijun soars on new antiviral drug * China stock down; steel, power shares stay strong (Updates to midday) By Donny Kwok, Claire Zhang and Edmund Klamann HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares rose
on Monday, tracking firmer overseas markets with Chinese finance
plays leading the rise, while Shanghai stocks dipped on
profit-taking after last week&apos;s rally to a three-month high. &quot;Abundant liquidity drove up local stocks, but too much
upside is unlikely especially when the index hovers above 22,000
mark,&quot; said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer of KGI Asia. The
recent rally was unjustified by economic fundamentals, he added. The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI rose to a two-week high
of 22,139.71 before steadying at 22,063.16 at midday, up 1.07
percent or 233.44 points and extending the previous session&apos;s
1.63 percent gain. Hong Kong assets look attractive given the territory&apos;s peg to
a weak U.S. dollar. Hong Kong&apos;s central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
injected a total HK$9.3 billion (US$1.2 billion) into the money
market in Hong Kong and New York last Friday as the Hong Kong
dollar HKD= repeatedly hit the top of its trading band at
7.7500 as funds poured into the stock market. [ID:nHKG237502] Optimism over economy growth in the mainland aided demand for
Chinese finance plays with China Life (2628.HK), the world&apos;s top
life insurer by market value, rose 1.7 percent to HK$38.10. ICBC (1398.HK) gained 2.01 percent to HK$6.59 and Bank of
Communications (3328.HK) rose 1.5 percent to HK$9.75. Banks in China are expected to lend 8 trillion-9 trillion
yuan ($1.2 billion-$1.3 billion) in 2010, down from this year&apos;s
forecast new-loan total of 10 trillion yuan, Bank of
Communications (601328.SS) said on Saturday. It said system-wide
non-performing loans (NPLs) would remain steady; the NPL ratio
might even fall because of growth in outstanding loans.
[ID:nPEK214189] Turnover was at HK$33.96 billion ($4.38 billion), down from
midday Friday&apos;s HK$37.01 billion. The China Enterprise Index .HSCE of top locally listed
mainland Chinese stocks rose 1.34 percent to 13,191.11. Dongfeng Motor Group Co (0489.HK) gained 1.1 percent to HK$11
after China&apos;s third-largest carmaker said its sales in October
rose 76.98 percent from a year earlier. [ID:nSHA225953] Lijun (2005.HK) surged to an all time high of HK$1.86 before
steadying at HK$1.47, still up 11.4 percent. The Chinese
drugmaker said it saw a promising market for its new antiviral
drug, Enerxin, which has been proven by the State Key Laboratory
of Virology as effective in restraining growth and blocking the
invasion of cells by the influenza A virus (H1N1) in its early
stages, similar to the function of Tamiflu. SHANGHAI DIPS; POWER, STEEL SHARES STRONG China&apos;s key stock index dipped 0.2 percent on Monday, weighed
down by profit-taking after last week&apos;s rally to a three-month
high, but power and steel shares were strong as the market drew
continued support from expectations of strong economic data for
October. The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended the morning at
3,157.552 points, after posting its best weekly rise in more than
three months last week. Losing Shanghai A shares outnumbered gainers by 443 to 421,
while turnover remained active at 85 billion yuan ($12 billion),
although down from Friday morning&apos;s 94 billion yuan. &quot;This is a mild and rational consolidation after last week&apos;s
strong gains,&quot; said Wen Lijun, analyst at Nanjing Securities, who
added that investors were expecting upbeat economic data for
October, which is due for release on Wednesday. China&apos;s money supply and lending growth are expected to have
maintained a rapid pace last month as Beijing held to its loose
monetary policy stance, according to a Reuters poll.
[ID:nSP458045] Central bank adviser Fan Gang told Reuters late on Friday
that China&apos;s economy had stabilised and was on track to achieve
growth of 8 percent next year but Beijing would stick to its
loose fiscal and monetary policies for now. [ID:nSGN002268] PetroChina (601857.SS), the most heavily weighted share in
the index, slipped 0.87 percent to 13.64 yuan, after U.S. crude
futures fell nearly 3 percent on Friday. Electric power sector shares were strong, with Datang
International Power Generation (601991.SS) jumping 4.88 percent
to 9.67 yuan while Huadian Power (600027.SS) rose 2.22 percent to
5.53 yuan and Huaneng Power International (600011.SS) advanced
2.33 percent to 8.33 yuan. The official Shanghai Securities News reported on Friday that
China may raise power prices charged on consumers by up to nearly
5 percent this month, intensifying speculation that Beijing could
make the first price move in 15 months very soon. [ID:nPEK232338] Steel shares outperformed after news of a possible merger in
the sector, with Baoshan Iron and Steel (600019.SS) gaining 2.07
percent to 7.41 yuan. Laiwu Steel Corp (600102.SS) and Jinan Iron and Steel Co
(600022.SS), whose shares have been suspended from trading, said
they may merge into a single company, part of consolidation
efforts by their parent, Shandong Iron and Steel Group. Metal shares were firmer, with Shandong Gold (600547.SS)
jumping 6.53 percent to 75 yuan, as gold prices edged up and held
near a record high on Monday.

 (Updates to close) By Donny Kwok, Claire Zhang and Edmund Klamann HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks ended
1.73 percent higher on Monday with Chinese banks including ICBC
(1398.HK) leading gains, while Shanghai shares rose for a seventh
consecutive session to a three-month closing high. Abundant liquidity due to a persistent inflow of funds drove
the market up as Hong Kong assets look attractive given the
territory&apos;s peg to a weak U.S. dollar. &quot;The market was building up momentum for a breakthrough on
the upside,&quot; said Conita Hung, head of equity of research of
Delta Asia Financial. &quot;Chinese lenders appeared particularly
appealing to longer term investors as their fundamentals are
improving.&quot; ICBC (1398.HK), the world&apos;s biggest bank by market value,
rose 3.1 percent to HK$6.66, its highest close since November
2007. China Construction Bank (0939.HK), China&apos;s No.2 lender by
value, gained 3.1 percent to HK$6.98. Banks in China are expected to lend 8 trillion-9 trillion
yuan ($1.2 billion-$1.3 billion) in 2010, down from this year&apos;s

[ID:nPEK214189] The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI closed up 377.83 points
at 22,207.55, its highest close in more than two-week. Turnover rose to HK$65.09 billion ($8.4 billion), up from
 HK$64.43 billion on Friday. China Life (2628.HK), the world&apos;s top life insurer by market
value, rose 2.54 percent to HK$38.40, its highest close since
Jan. 10, 2008. Dongfeng Motor Group Co (0489.HK) gained 1.65
percent to HK$11.06 after China&apos;s third-largest carmaker said its
sales in October rose 76.98 percent from a year earlier.
[ID:nSHA225953] The China Enterprises Index .HSCE of top locally listed
mainland Chinese stocks rose 2.31 percent to 13,318.48. Demand for laggards also boosted China Shenhua (1088.HK),
which climbed 3.91 percent to HK$38.55, its highest close since
April 24, 2008. Chinese drugmaker Lijun (2005.HK) rose to an all-time high of
HK$1.86 before closing at HK$1.40, up 6.82 percent. It said it
saw a promising market for its new antiviral drug which has been
proven by the State Key Laboratory of Virology as effective in
blocking the invasion of cells by the influenza A virus (H1N1) in
its early stages, similar to the function of Tamiflu. SHANGHAI UP FOR 7TH SESSION China&apos;s key stock index edged up 0.36 percent on Monday,
rising for a seventh consecutive session to a three-month closing
high, with power and steel shares strong as the market was
boosted by expectations of strong economic data for October. The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended at 3,175.585
points, after posting its best weekly rise in more than three
months last week. Gaining Shanghai A shares outnumbered losers by 553 to 324,
although turnover sank to 158 billion yuan ($23.15 billion) from
Friday&apos;s 181 billion yuan. Investors are widely expecting upbeat economic data for
October, with several of the key numbers due for release on
Wednesday. China&apos;s money supply and bank lending are expected to have
maintained a rapid pace of growth last month as Beijing held to

that China&apos;s economy had stabilised and was on track to achieve
growth of 8 percent next year but Beijing would stick to its
loose fiscal and monetary policies for now. [ID:nSGN002268] Despite the upbeat sentiment in the market, analysts said it
may also be vulnerable to profit-taking pressure after its
extended gains. &quot;The index has put in a strong performance, but tomorrow it
would be reasonable to see it posting either a modest gain or
loss. Nevertheless, with funds continuing to pour into the stock
market, the index may move higher this week,&quot; said Zhou Lin,
analyst at Huatai Securities in Nanjing. Electric power sector shares were strong, with Datang
International Power Generation (601991.SS) jumping 6.18 percent
to 9.79 yuan, while Huadian Power (600027.SS) rose 2.4 percent to
5.54 yuan and Huaneng Power International (600011.SS) advanced
2.58 percent to 8.35 yuan. The official Shanghai Securities News reported on Friday that

* Raises &apos;09 profit and rev view

Nov 9 (Reuters) - SciClone Pharmaceuticals Inc (SCLN.O) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong sales of its hepatitis B treatment and lower research and development expenses, and raised its 2009 forecast.

Third-quarter net income was $2.1 million, or 4 cents a share, compared to $773,000, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. [ID:nWNAB2726]

Revenue for the quarter rose 20 percent to $17.2 million. Research and development expenses for the quarter fell about 9 percent to $4.3 million.

Analysts were expecting earnings of 1 cent, on revenue of $16.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

For 2009, the company now expects to earn 18 cents to 22 cents a share, up from its prior view of 10 cents to 14 cents.

Revenue is expected to be between $70 million and $72 million, compared to its previous expectation of $69 million to $71 million.

The company has lately come to prominence as it is trying to get its hepatitis B treatment Zadaxin to show that it can improve the effectiveness of H1N1 flu vaccines now being developed by other companies.

SciClone sells Zadaxin, a drug approved in China and other overseas markets, to treat hepatitis B infections and to boost the immune systems of other patients, including those with liver cancer.

    <body>OTTAWA, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The recession has cut profits by more than 20 percent across several Canadian industries, particularly wholesale trade and transportation, although most are expected to recover next year, the Conference Board of Canada said on Monday.

The conference board released a five-year outlook for six different industries, highlighting the impact of reduced demand and lower prices on their bottom lines.

At the same time, however, cost pressures are easing due to lower input prices and limited wage growth, said Michael Burt, associate director of industrial economic trends at the Ottawa-based organization.

Here is the 2009 profit outlook for each industry:

- Transportation and warehousing: profits down 29 percent from 2008 levels to C$5.2 billion ($4.9 billion). Robust recovery seen once the recession is past.

- Wholesale trade: profits down 23 percent to C$11.2 billion. Profit growth to resume in 2010.

- Retail trade: profits fall 32 percent in 2009 to C$8.6 billion, but unlike other industries the sector benefits from strong currency. Outlook to improve as employment and income recover.

- Food services: profits down 32 percent in 2009 to C$826 million. Lower-cost establishments held up well.

- Accommodation: Profits down 8 percent in 2009 to C$500 million. Recovery could be shaky due to H1N1 outbreak and impact of strong Canadian dollar on prices for foreigners.

- Food and beverage manufacturing: Profits to rise 3 percent to C$3.4 billion. Sector has been largely recession-proof.

By Sam Cage

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Novartis AG&apos;s (NOVN.VX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) drugs unit will continue to outgrow a sickly overall pharmaceuticals market, driven by new treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis and lung disease, its divisional chief said on Monday.

Joe Jimenez told the Reuters Health Summit in New York he expected the overall global drugs market to grow by a meager 3 to 4 percent in 2010 -- significantly less than the 4 to 6 percent seen by leading forecaster IMS Health.

But Novartis&apos; pharmaceutical business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of group sales and which led rivals with 11 percent growth in local currencies in the nine months to September, had the momentum to outshine others.

&quot;As long as we have a strong pipeline and we&apos;re continuing to launch compounds, we&apos;re going to continue to grow faster than the rest of the market,&quot; he said.

Hefty price increases and windfall sales arising from the H1N1 outbreak are helping major pharmaceutical companies, but long-term problems like more competition from makers of generic drugs have not gone away.

Jimenez sees a series of factors in the next two years that will crimp industry growth, including U.S. healthcare reform, price cuts in Japan and a government budget squeeze in Europe.

REVENUE GAP

Novartis loses patent protection on its top-selling blood pressure drug Diovan in 2012 -- rivals like Pfizer Inc (PFE.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) face similar problems -- and is developing a clutch of new medicines to fill the gap.

New lung drug QAB149 was on track to receive final European Union approval before the end of the year and Jimenez said the Swiss drugmaker would meet with U.S. regulators in the coming weeks to iron out issues, before starting combination trials.

QAB149&apos;s biggest potential lies in use alongside other drugs, including Vectura Group Plc&apos;s (VEC.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) NVA237.

Jimenez said the lower dose of oral multiple sclerosis drug FTY720, which Novartis plans to file with regulators next month, was &quot;clearly approvable&quot; and would be an attractive option for patients seeking an alternative to injections.

It is in a head-to-head race with Merck KGaA&apos;s (MRCG.DE: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) cladribine to be the first oral MS drug on the market and the German group has stolen a march having already filed for approval in the United States.

Jimenez also highlighted recently launched cancer drug Afinitor as a potential multibillion-dollar seller, adding its early commercial success had increased confidence in its prospects.

Despite this, Novartis is keen to acquire rights to new drugs -- either via acquisitions or licensing deals -- particularly in areas where it already has expertise, such as cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, Jimenez said.

&quot;We have over 150 projects in clinical development and over 60 of them are new compounds. But that&apos;s still not going to stop us from going out and finding good assets -- and they&apos;re out there,&quot; he added.

By Deena Beasley

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Health insurer WellPoint Inc (WLP.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) is interested in expanding its Medicare business despite the likelihood of cost cuts from a U.S. healthcare overhaul, the company&apos;s chief executive told Reuters on Monday.

Angela Braly, speaking at the Reuters Health Summit in New York, said WellPoint continues &quot;to look at the opportunity for acquisitions,&quot; but a &quot;major acquisition of a health insurance company would be difficult until there is more clarity&quot; on health reform.

The CEO said WellPoint will also continue to pursue Medicaid business, with the key being whether there is &quot;an actuarially sound rate that would be paid&quot; by states administering the federal coverage plan for the poor.

She also said health insurance premiums will rise if the health reform legislation passed by the House of Representatives on Saturday were to become law.

The bill &quot;would actually raise the cost for those with coverage,&quot; Braly said. She cited &quot;significant taxes and fees,&quot; as well as insurance market reforms that would have the impact of increasing coverage costs.

The CEO said a key issue is an enforceable mandate requiring individuals to purchase healthcare coverage. &quot;We think if you can get people in the pool and keep them there, it will be affordable,&quot; Braly said.

She also said current healthcare proposals could force the company, the largest health insurer by membership, to resort to layoffs.

Asked how health reform might stress hospitals, she said, &quot;Our perception is it could potentially bankrupt some hospitals, depending on the scenario&quot; of eventual reforms, including &quot;some significant hospitals.&quot;

In the event reform includes a public option plan, she said some hospitals could receive much lower reimbursements, in line with Medicare and Medicaid payments.

As hospitals go bankrupt, she said lost services would create an &quot;access question&quot; for patients.

&quot;The question is whether we&apos;re solving or creating access problems in another way,&quot; Braly said.

She said the company&apos;s 2010 profitability will depend, in part, on the severity of the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu season. &quot;We&apos;re anticipating it to have a significant impact on the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2010. We have seen a significant increase in Tamiflu and Relenza prescriptions.&quot;

She said the impact on the company will be easier to assess after getting the latest data on doctors&apos; visits. But she noted that the costs of Tamiflu, Relenza and doctors&apos; visits are not nearly as costly to the company as services rendered at hospitals.

WellPoint said last month that flu costs and Cobra coverage for workers who lost their jobs would raise its costs for 2010, resulting in lower operating earnings next year.

Braly said WellPoint expects to close on the $4.68 billion sale of its pharmacy benefit plan by year-end, with the expectation that &quot;a significant part&quot; of the proceeds would be used to buy back shares.  Continued...

    <body>* HK stocks up on abundant liquidity; finance leads * Lijun soars on new antiviral drug * China stock down; steel, power shares stay strong (Updates to midday) By Donny Kwok, Claire Zhang and Edmund Klamann HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares rose
on Monday, tracking firmer overseas markets with Chinese finance
plays leading the rise, while Shanghai stocks dipped on
profit-taking after last week&apos;s rally to a three-month high. &quot;Abundant liquidity drove up local stocks, but too much
upside is unlikely especially when the index hovers above 22,000
mark,&quot; said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer of KGI Asia. The
recent rally was unjustified by economic fundamentals, he added. The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI rose to a two-week high
of 22,139.71 before steadying at 22,063.16 at midday, up 1.07
percent or 233.44 points and extending the previous session&apos;s
1.63 percent gain. Hong Kong assets look attractive given the territory&apos;s peg to
a weak U.S. dollar. Hong Kong&apos;s central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
injected a total HK$9.3 billion (US$1.2 billion) into the money
market in Hong Kong and New York last Friday as the Hong Kong
dollar HKD= repeatedly hit the top of its trading band at
7.7500 as funds poured into the stock market. [ID:nHKG237502] Optimism over economy growth in the mainland aided demand for
Chinese finance plays with China Life (2628.HK), the world&apos;s top
life insurer by market value, rose 1.7 percent to HK$38.10. ICBC (1398.HK) gained 2.01 percent to HK$6.59 and Bank of
Communications (3328.HK) rose 1.5 percent to HK$9.75. Banks in China are expected to lend 8 trillion-9 trillion
yuan ($1.2 billion-$1.3 billion) in 2010, down from this year&apos;s
forecast new-loan total of 10 trillion yuan, Bank of
Communications (601328.SS) said on Saturday. It said system-wide
non-performing loans (NPLs) would remain steady; the NPL ratio
might even fall because of growth in outstanding loans.
[ID:nPEK214189] Turnover was at HK$33.96 billion ($4.38 billion), down from
midday Friday&apos;s HK$37.01 billion. The China Enterprise Index .HSCE of top locally listed
mainland Chinese stocks rose 1.34 percent to 13,191.11. Dongfeng Motor Group Co (0489.HK) gained 1.1 percent to HK$11
after China&apos;s third-largest carmaker said its sales in October
rose 76.98 percent from a year earlier. [ID:nSHA225953] Lijun (2005.HK) surged to an all time high of HK$1.86 before
steadying at HK$1.47, still up 11.4 percent. The Chinese
drugmaker said it saw a promising market for its new antiviral
drug, Enerxin, which has been proven by the State Key Laboratory
of Virology as effective in restraining growth and blocking the
invasion of cells by the influenza A virus (H1N1) in its early
stages, similar to the function of Tamiflu. SHANGHAI DIPS; POWER, STEEL SHARES STRONG China&apos;s key stock index dipped 0.2 percent on Monday, weighed
down by profit-taking after last week&apos;s rally to a three-month
high, but power and steel shares were strong as the market drew
continued support from expectations of strong economic data for
October. The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended the morning at
3,157.552 points, after posting its best weekly rise in more than
three months last week. Losing Shanghai A shares outnumbered gainers by 443 to 421,
while turnover remained active at 85 billion yuan ($12 billion),
although down from Friday morning&apos;s 94 billion yuan. &quot;This is a mild and rational consolidation after last week&apos;s
strong gains,&quot; said Wen Lijun, analyst at Nanjing Securities, who
added that investors were expecting upbeat economic data for
October, which is due for release on Wednesday. China&apos;s money supply and lending growth are expected to have
maintained a rapid pace last month as Beijing held to its loose
monetary policy stance, according to a Reuters poll.
[ID:nSP458045] Central bank adviser Fan Gang told Reuters late on Friday
that China&apos;s economy had stabilised and was on track to achieve
growth of 8 percent next year but Beijing would stick to its
loose fiscal and monetary policies for now. [ID:nSGN002268] PetroChina (601857.SS), the most heavily weighted share in
the index, slipped 0.87 percent to 13.64 yuan, after U.S. crude
futures fell nearly 3 percent on Friday. Electric power sector shares were strong, with Datang
International Power Generation (601991.SS) jumping 4.88 percent
to 9.67 yuan while Huadian Power (600027.SS) rose 2.22 percent to
5.53 yuan and Huaneng Power International (600011.SS) advanced
2.33 percent to 8.33 yuan. The official Shanghai Securities News reported on Friday that
China may raise power prices charged on consumers by up to nearly
5 percent this month, intensifying speculation that Beijing could
make the first price move in 15 months very soon. [ID:nPEK232338] Steel shares outperformed after news of a possible merger in
the sector, with Baoshan Iron and Steel (600019.SS) gaining 2.07
percent to 7.41 yuan. Laiwu Steel Corp (600102.SS) and Jinan Iron and Steel Co
(600022.SS), whose shares have been suspended from trading, said
they may merge into a single company, part of consolidation
efforts by their parent, Shandong Iron and Steel Group. Metal shares were firmer, with Shandong Gold (600547.SS)
jumping 6.53 percent to 75 yuan, as gold prices edged up and held
near a record high on Monday.

    <body>* HK shares gain on abundant liquidity; Chinese banks up * Shanghai up for a 7th session to three-month high
 (Updates to close) By Donny Kwok, Claire Zhang and Edmund Klamann HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks ended
1.73 percent higher on Monday with Chinese banks including ICBC
(1398.HK) leading gains, while Shanghai shares rose for a seventh
consecutive session to a three-month closing high. Abundant liquidity due to a persistent inflow of funds drove
the market up as Hong Kong assets look attractive given the
territory&apos;s peg to a weak U.S. dollar. &quot;The market was building up momentum for a breakthrough on
the upside,&quot; said Conita Hung, head of equity of research of
Delta Asia Financial. &quot;Chinese lenders appeared particularly
appealing to longer term investors as their fundamentals are
improving.&quot; ICBC (1398.HK), the world&apos;s biggest bank by market value,
rose 3.1 percent to HK$6.66, its highest close since November
2007. China Construction Bank (0939.HK), China&apos;s No.2 lender by
value, gained 3.1 percent to HK$6.98. Banks in China are expected to lend 8 trillion-9 trillion
yuan ($1.2 billion-$1.3 billion) in 2010, down from this year&apos;s
forecast new-loan total of 10 trillion yuan, Bank of
Communications (601328.SS) said on Saturday. It said system-wide
non-performing loans (NPLs) would remain steady; the NPL ratio
might even fall because of growth in outstanding loans.
[ID:nPEK214189] The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI closed up 377.83 points
at 22,207.55, its highest close in more than two-week. Turnover rose to HK$65.09 billion ($8.4 billion), up from
 HK$64.43 billion on Friday. China Life (2628.HK), the world&apos;s top life insurer by market
value, rose 2.54 percent to HK$38.40, its highest close since
Jan. 10, 2008. Dongfeng Motor Group Co (0489.HK) gained 1.65
percent to HK$11.06 after China&apos;s third-largest carmaker said its
sales in October rose 76.98 percent from a year earlier.
[ID:nSHA225953] The China Enterprises Index .HSCE of top locally listed
mainland Chinese stocks rose 2.31 percent to 13,318.48. Demand for laggards also boosted China Shenhua (1088.HK),
which climbed 3.91 percent to HK$38.55, its highest close since
April 24, 2008. Chinese drugmaker Lijun (2005.HK) rose to an all-time high of
HK$1.86 before closing at HK$1.40, up 6.82 percent. It said it
saw a promising market for its new antiviral drug which has been
proven by the State Key Laboratory of Virology as effective in
blocking the invasion of cells by the influenza A virus (H1N1) in
its early stages, similar to the function of Tamiflu. SHANGHAI UP FOR 7TH SESSION China&apos;s key stock index edged up 0.36 percent on Monday,
rising for a seventh consecutive session to a three-month closing
high, with power and steel shares strong as the market was
boosted by expectations of strong economic data for October. The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended at 3,175.585
points, after posting its best weekly rise in more than three
months last week. Gaining Shanghai A shares outnumbered losers by 553 to 324,
although turnover sank to 158 billion yuan ($23.15 billion) from
Friday&apos;s 181 billion yuan. Investors are widely expecting upbeat economic data for
October, with several of the key numbers due for release on
Wednesday. China&apos;s money supply and bank lending are expected to have
maintained a rapid pace of growth last month as Beijing held to
its loose monetary policy stance, according to a Reuters poll.
[ID:nSP458045] Central bank adviser Fan Gang told Reuters late on Friday
that China&apos;s economy had stabilised and was on track to achieve
growth of 8 percent next year but Beijing would stick to its
loose fiscal and monetary policies for now. [ID:nSGN002268] Despite the upbeat sentiment in the market, analysts said it
may also be vulnerable to profit-taking pressure after its
extended gains. &quot;The index has put in a strong performance, but tomorrow it
would be reasonable to see it posting either a modest gain or
loss. Nevertheless, with funds continuing to pour into the stock
market, the index may move higher this week,&quot; said Zhou Lin,
analyst at Huatai Securities in Nanjing. Electric power sector shares were strong, with Datang
International Power Generation (601991.SS) jumping 6.18 percent
to 9.79 yuan, while Huadian Power (600027.SS) rose 2.4 percent to
5.54 yuan and Huaneng Power International (600011.SS) advanced
2.58 percent to 8.35 yuan. The official Shanghai Securities News reported on Friday that
China may raise power prices charged to consumers by up to nearly
5 percent this month, intensifying speculation that Beijing could
make the first price move in 15 months very soon. [ID:nPEK232338] Steel shares outperformed after news of a possible merger in
the sector, with Baoshan Iron and Steel (600019.SS) gaining 1.65
percent to 7.38 yuan. Laiwu Steel Corp (600102.SS) and Jinan Iron and Steel Co
(600022.SS), whose shares have been suspended from trading, said
they may merge into a single company, part of consolidation
efforts by their parent, Shandong Iron and Steel Group. Metals shares were firmer, with Shandong Gold (600547.SS)
jumping 7.66 percent to 75.79 yuan, as gold prices edged up and

    <body>* Q3 EPS 4 cents vs est 1 cent

* Q3 revenue $17.2 mln vs est $16.8 mln

* Raises &apos;09 profit and rev view

Nov 9 (Reuters) - SciClone Pharmaceuticals Inc (SCLN.O) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong sales of its hepatitis B treatment and lower research and development expenses, and raised its 2009 forecast.

Third-quarter net income was $2.1 million, or 4 cents a share, compared to $773,000, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. [ID:nWNAB2726]

Revenue for the quarter rose 20 percent to $17.2 million. Research and development expenses for the quarter fell about 9 percent to $4.3 million.

Analysts were expecting earnings of 1 cent, on revenue of $16.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

For 2009, the company now expects to earn 18 cents to 22 cents a share, up from its prior view of 10 cents to 14 cents.

Revenue is expected to be between $70 million and $72 million, compared to its previous expectation of $69 million to $71 million.

The company has lately come to prominence as it is trying to get its hepatitis B treatment Zadaxin to show that it can improve the effectiveness of H1N1 flu vaccines now being developed by other companies.

SciClone sells Zadaxin, a drug approved in China and other overseas markets, to treat hepatitis B infections and to boost the immune systems of other patients, including those with liver cancer.

    <summary>... $500 million. Recovery could be shaky due to H1N1 outbreak and impact of strong Canadian dollar on prices for foreigners. - Food ...</summary>
    <body>OTTAWA, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The recession has cut profits by more than 20 percent across several Canadian industries, particularly wholesale trade and transportation, although most are expected to recover next year, the Conference Board of Canada said on Monday.

The conference board released a five-year outlook for six different industries, highlighting the impact of reduced demand and lower prices on their bottom lines.

At the same time, however, cost pressures are easing due to lower input prices and limited wage growth, said Michael Burt, associate director of industrial economic trends at the Ottawa-based organization.

Here is the 2009 profit outlook for each industry:

- Transportation and warehousing: profits down 29 percent from 2008 levels to C$5.2 billion ($4.9 billion). Robust recovery seen once the recession is past.

- Wholesale trade: profits down 23 percent to C$11.2 billion. Profit growth to resume in 2010.

- Retail trade: profits fall 32 percent in 2009 to C$8.6 billion, but unlike other industries the sector benefits from strong currency. Outlook to improve as employment and income recover.

- Food services: profits down 32 percent in 2009 to C$826 million. Lower-cost establishments held up well.

- Accommodation: Profits down 8 percent in 2009 to C$500 million. Recovery could be shaky due to H1N1 outbreak and impact of strong Canadian dollar on prices for foreigners.

- Food and beverage manufacturing: Profits to rise 3 percent to C$3.4 billion. Sector has been largely recession-proof.

By Sam Cage

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Novartis AG&apos;s (NOVN.VX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) drugs unit will continue to outgrow a sickly overall pharmaceuticals market, driven by new treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis and lung disease, its divisional chief said on Monday.

Joe Jimenez told the Reuters Health Summit in New York he expected the overall global drugs market to grow by a meager 3 to 4 percent in 2010 -- significantly less than the 4 to 6 percent seen by leading forecaster IMS Health.

But Novartis&apos; pharmaceutical business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of group sales and which led rivals with 11 percent growth in local currencies in the nine months to September, had the momentum to outshine others.

&quot;As long as we have a strong pipeline and we&apos;re continuing to launch compounds, we&apos;re going to continue to grow faster than the rest of the market,&quot; he said.

Hefty price increases and windfall sales arising from the H1N1 outbreak are helping major pharmaceutical companies, but long-term problems like more competition from makers of generic drugs have not gone away.

Jimenez sees a series of factors in the next two years that will crimp industry growth, including U.S. healthcare reform, price cuts in Japan and a government budget squeeze in Europe.

REVENUE GAP

Novartis loses patent protection on its top-selling blood pressure drug Diovan in 2012 -- rivals like Pfizer Inc (PFE.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) face similar problems -- and is developing a clutch of new medicines to fill the gap.

New lung drug QAB149 was on track to receive final European Union approval before the end of the year and Jimenez said the Swiss drugmaker would meet with U.S. regulators in the coming weeks to iron out issues, before starting combination trials.

QAB149&apos;s biggest potential lies in use alongside other drugs, including Vectura Group Plc&apos;s (VEC.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) NVA237.

Jimenez said the lower dose of oral multiple sclerosis drug FTY720, which Novartis plans to file with regulators next month, was &quot;clearly approvable&quot; and would be an attractive option for patients seeking an alternative to injections.

It is in a head-to-head race with Merck KGaA&apos;s (MRCG.DE: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) cladribine to be the first oral MS drug on the market and the German group has stolen a march having already filed for approval in the United States.

Jimenez also highlighted recently launched cancer drug Afinitor as a potential multibillion-dollar seller, adding its early commercial success had increased confidence in its prospects.

Despite this, Novartis is keen to acquire rights to new drugs -- either via acquisitions or licensing deals -- particularly in areas where it already has expertise, such as cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, Jimenez said.

&quot;We have over 150 projects in clinical development and over 60 of them are new compounds. But that&apos;s still not going to stop us from going out and finding good assets -- and they&apos;re out there,&quot; he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Health insurer WellPoint Inc (WLP.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) is interested in expanding its Medicare business despite the likelihood of cost cuts from a U.S. healthcare overhaul, the company&apos;s chief executive told Reuters on Monday.

Angela Braly, speaking at the Reuters Health Summit in New York, said WellPoint continues &quot;to look at the opportunity for acquisitions,&quot; but a &quot;major acquisition of a health insurance company would be difficult until there is more clarity&quot; on health reform.

The CEO said WellPoint will also continue to pursue Medicaid business, with the key being whether there is &quot;an actuarially sound rate that would be paid&quot; by states administering the federal coverage plan for the poor.

She also said health insurance premiums will rise if the health reform legislation passed by the House of Representatives on Saturday were to become law.

The bill &quot;would actually raise the cost for those with coverage,&quot; Braly said. She cited &quot;significant taxes and fees,&quot; as well as insurance market reforms that would have the impact of increasing coverage costs.

The CEO said a key issue is an enforceable mandate requiring individuals to purchase healthcare coverage. &quot;We think if you can get people in the pool and keep them there, it will be affordable,&quot; Braly said.

She also said current healthcare proposals could force the company, the largest health insurer by membership, to resort to layoffs.

Asked how health reform might stress hospitals, she said, &quot;Our perception is it could potentially bankrupt some hospitals, depending on the scenario&quot; of eventual reforms, including &quot;some significant hospitals.&quot;

In the event reform includes a public option plan, she said some hospitals could receive much lower reimbursements, in line with Medicare and Medicaid payments.

As hospitals go bankrupt, she said lost services would create an &quot;access question&quot; for patients.

&quot;The question is whether we&apos;re solving or creating access problems in another way,&quot; Braly said.

She said the company&apos;s 2010 profitability will depend, in part, on the severity of the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu season. &quot;We&apos;re anticipating it to have a significant impact on the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2010. We have seen a significant increase in Tamiflu and Relenza prescriptions.&quot;

She said the impact on the company will be easier to assess after getting the latest data on doctors&apos; visits. But she noted that the costs of Tamiflu, Relenza and doctors&apos; visits are not nearly as costly to the company as services rendered at hospitals.

WellPoint said last month that flu costs and Cobra coverage for workers who lost their jobs would raise its costs for 2010, resulting in lower operating earnings next year.

Braly said WellPoint expects to close on the $4.68 billion sale of its pharmacy benefit plan by year-end, with the expectation that &quot;a significant part&quot; of the proceeds would be used to buy back shares.  Continued...

    <summary>... which polls show Yushchenko looks very likely to lose, could be set back to May if a state of emergency is declared because of an outbreak of the H1N1 flu. ...</summary>
    <body>By Sabina Zawadzki

KIEV, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Ukraine&apos;s leader Viktor Yushchenko on Sunday dismissed the idea a January election should be delayed because of flu fears and appeared to accept there would be no more IMF funds forthcoming until after the vote.

An aide to Yushchenko wrote late on Friday the presidential election, which polls show Yushchenko looks very likely to lose, could be set back to May if a state of emergency is declared because of an outbreak of the H1N1 flu. [ID:nL695938]

On Sunday when asked whether he should impose a state of emergency on Ukraine, delaying any poll, Yushchenko told news channel 5 Kanal in an interview:

&quot;No -- there are no reasons for this.&quot;

Ihor Popov, a senior presidential official, accused Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko&apos;s government of being taken unawares by the flu epidemic that has killed more than 100 people in the past three weeks and said a state of emergency could be declared.

Yushchenko and Tymoshenko have hurled bitter recriminations at each other over the past 18 months. Both will run in the first presidential election since the 2004 &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; swept the two former allies to power. With public support at 5 percent or lower, Yushchenko is unlikely to win re-election. Tymoshenko and Viktor Yanukovich -- a former prime minister who was also the Russian-backed loser in the Orange Revolution -- are both front-runners now.

Tymoshenko, former foreign minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and parliament speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn, both candidates objected to Popov&apos;s idea. Only Yanukovich stayed silent on the issue.

While the political elite has squabbled, Ukraine has plunged into a deep recession -- its economy was expected to shrink by up to 15 percent this year after steel exports fell and the hryvnia currency plummeted.

The ex-Soviet republic had been surviving on a $16.4 billion lifeline from the International Monetary Fund -- more than $10 billion of this bailout has been released, propping up the hryvnia and shoring up state finances.

But IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Saturday the fund, which has delayed the release of a $3.8 billion tranche because of plans to raise wages, would only renew co-operation after the presidential election. [ID:nL7340550]

Parliament voted to raise pensions and the minimum wage by 20 percent by the end of next year -- a measure the government said would cost more than $10 billion and which it was against. Yushchenko brought the law into force by signing it last month.

On Sunday, Yushchenko shirked any blame for the suspension of the IMF programme saying the government had broken four out of five promises it had made to the IMF.

&quot;I am convinced that the IMF will not give Ukraine the (fourth) tranche,&quot; he told the news channel. (Editing by Matthew Jones)</body>

    <body>* Saudi Arabia to start H1N1 inoculation with pilgrims

* Glaxo is kingdom&apos;s sole supplier of H1N1 vaccine for now

RIYADH, Nov 7 (Reuters) - British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) is currently Saudi Arabia&apos;s sole supplier of an H1N1 flu vaccine but the kingdom may include other firms for the supply of a nationwide inoculation campaign, the health ministry said.

Saudi Arabia&apos;s vaccination campaign was launched on Saturday and will first focus on pilgrims and health workers.

&quot;For the moment, the only vaccine that has been authorised is the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine Pandemrix,&quot; health ministry spokesman Khaled Mirghalani told Reuters.

&quot;We will in the future get vaccines from other clients, from other companies, as soon as they get approved by the SFDA (Saudi Food and Drug Authority),&quot; he said.

Around 3 million Muslim pilgrims from more than 160 countries take part in the haj in the holy city of Mecca most years, including up to 2 million who travel from abroad. Haj this year will start in during the last week of November.

Disease experts from the United States and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, have said waves of the H1N1 flu virus spread by pilgrims travelling to and from Mecca for haj could put pressure on healthcare systems around the world.

The pilgrimage provides perfect conditions for the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, which is transmitted by sneezing and physical contact.

The country will launch later this month a second inoculation campaign aimed at schools, Health Minister Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz al-Rabeea said on Saturday.

GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among some 25 companies producing pandemic vaccine and other drugmakers including Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding (ROG.VX) are making antivirals for use as a frontline H1N1 drug.

According to the World Health Organization&apos;s latest death toll, which is thought to underestimate the total spread of the virus, at least 6,000 people worldwide have died as a result of an H1N1 infection since its discovery earlier this year in Mexico and the United States.

    <body>BRATISLAVA, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Slovakia said on Saturday it would close all but one road border crossing with Ukraine on Sunday because of Ukraine&apos;s flu epidemic.

Vysne Nemecke, the biggest checkpoint, will be the only one to stay open.

&quot;The reason is the continuing worsening of the epidemic situation in Ukraine,&quot; Interior Minister Robert Kalinak told journalists. &quot;This is intended to minimize any eventual outbreak of the disease.&quot;

Kalinak said the EU member state&apos;s decision was temporary and aimed to protect the bloc.

Doctors and hygienists will be stationed at the border to monitor passengers and have the powers to bar anyone suspected of being infected from entering the country.

* H1N1 may kill up to 40,000 in Europe, same as seasonal flu

By Kate Kelland

STOCKHOLM, Nov 6 (Reuters) - The H1N1 pandemic flu virus could kill up to 40,000 people across Europe and be followed by seasonal flu waves that could kill the same number, European health experts said on Friday.

The Sweden-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said epidemics of H1N1, known as swine flu, were now affecting almost all countries in the European Union but it could not predict how intense the peaks would be.

What was certain, it said, was that the pandemic would continue to kill thousands and put many patients into intensive care as the northern hemisphere&apos;s winter sets in.

&quot;All European countries will be affected, and this will put considerable stress on healthcare systems,&quot; said ECDC director Zsuzsanna Jakab.

The ECDC, which monitors disease in the European Union and European free trade area (EFTA), said it was hard to predict what the mix of pandemic and seasonal flu viruses would bring but there was a risk of seasonal flu epidemics &quot;early in 2010 when the pandemic waves have passed&quot;.

Angus Nicoll, the ECDC&apos;s flu coordinator, said in non-pandemic situations, seasonal flu could kill up to 40,000 people in Europe -- and H1N1 could do the same.

&quot;That is not a trivial number,&quot; he said. &quot;And the fact that H1N1 is happening in younger adults, pregnant women and people without risk factors ... makes it feel different.&quot;

RISKS AND DEATHS

The ECDC said experience from the United States and the southern hemisphere showed pregnant women with the virus are 10 times more likely to need intensive care than those with no risk factors. Those with asthma and chronic respiratory diseases have three times the risk and the very obese six times the risk.

But it also said evidence so far shows some 20 to 30 percent of H1N1 deaths are among healthy young people.

The ECDC&apos;s latest daily update said all 27 EU and four EFTA countries have cases of H1N1 pandemic flu and there have been 389 deaths linked to H1N1 in the region since April, including 154 in Britain, 73 in Spain, 25 in Italy and 22 in France.

The ECDC&apos;s global toll showed 6,005 fatal cases of H1N1 have been reported. The WHO, which updates its figures weekly, said on Thursday 5,712 people have died worldwide since H1N1 was discovered earlier this year.

The ECDC said the numbers of fatal cases associated with pandemic flu were &quot;likely to be gross underestimates&quot; as access to healthcare and lab tests varied from country to country.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among some 25 companies making pandemic vaccines, while other drugmakers including Roche (ROG.VX) are making antiviral therapies for use as frontline H1N1 treatment.

Nicoll said vaccination programmes which started in some European countries in recent weeks were vital to protecting those most at risk but had come too late to halt the disease.

&quot;We&apos;re not trying at this stage to protect the whole of society with the vaccines. The strategy is to protect the vulnerable.&quot; (Editing by Janet Lawrence)</body>

Those with asthma and chronic respiratory diseases have three times the risk and the very obese six times the risk.

But it also said evidence so far shows some 20 to 30 percent of H1N1 deaths are among healthy young people.

The ECDC&apos;s latest daily update said all 27 EU and four EFTA countries have cases of H1N1 pandemic flu and there have been 389 deaths linked to H1N1 in the region since April, including 154 in Britain, 73 in Spain, 25 in Italy and 22 in France.

The ECDC&apos;s global toll showed 6,005 fatal cases of H1N1 have been reported. The WHO, which updates its figures weekly, said on Thursday 5,712 people have died worldwide since H1N1 was discovered earlier this year.

The ECDC said the numbers of fatal cases associated with pandemic flu were &quot;likely to be gross underestimates&quot; as access to healthcare and lab tests varied from country to country.

GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis are among some 25 companies making pandemic vaccines, while other drugmakers including Roche are making antiviral therapies for use as frontline H1N1 treatment.

Nicoll said vaccination programs which started in some European countries in recent weeks were vital to protecting those most at risk but had come too late to halt the disease.

&quot;We&apos;re not trying at this stage to protect the whole of society with the vaccines. The strategy is to protect the vulnerable.&quot;

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Some countries have been &quot;ambushed&quot; by sudden severe outbreaks of disease and death from the H1N1 flu pandemic, and have gone over the top in their response, a European flu specialist said on Friday.

Angus Nicoll, influenza coordinator at the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said the apparent sudden surge of disease in Ukraine, which has reported at least 86 deaths from flu-like illness, was a feature of H1N1 -- which is mild in most people and can spread undetected for weeks.

&quot;The mildness is good in some ways, but it has also given the disease control people some problems,&quot; Nicoll said.

&quot;Then you get a Ukraine thing, where some countries have suddenly been ambushed by the pandemic and have gone over the top in their response.&quot;

Ukraine closed schools, banned public meetings including election rallies and restricted travel for three weeks from October 30 after it confirmed its first H1N1 death.

&quot;The best bet is that this is actually a country that is 6 weeks into its pandemic,&quot; Nicoll told reporters at a briefing. &quot;They just didn&apos;t notice it officially until young people started getting ill and going into hospital.&quot;

The epidemic coincides with the start of campaigning for a presidential election on January 17. and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who announced the measures and is a front-runner in the election, said the outbreak would affect campaign rallies.

A team of experts from the Stokholm-based ECDC and the World health Organization in Geneva has gone to Ukraine at the request of its health ministry and are currently working in Kiev and Lviv, the ECDC said in an update on the outbreak.

It said it was &quot;clear that pandemic H1N1.. has established itself in Ukraine&quot; and it was likely that most of the rapidly spreading cases of respiratory disease were related to H1N1 flu.

Bitter political rivals in Ukraine are seeking to blame each other for poor handling of the H1N1 flu outbreak as the election approaches.

Nicoll said it was a &quot;very complicated political situation&quot; but said some of the steps taken to try to halt the spread of the disease were &quot;very sensible&quot;: &quot;They have reinforced hygiene, they have rapidly imported anti-virals, and...closing schools may have been a sensible thing to do.&quot;

He said it was the relative mildness in most people who catch H1N1 flu, which the WHO declared a pandemic in June and which has killed more than 5,700 people around the world, was one of the reasons Ukraine had apparently taken by surprise.

The virus is &quot;not a big deal&quot; for most people who get it, he said, while for others it is &quot;very severe.&quot;

* Follows Yushchenko&apos;s criticism of govt handling of flu

* Over 750,000 people ill with flu, over 30 with H1N1 strain

(Adds details)

KIEV, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Ukraine could delay a January presidential election until May next year if the government fails to control an outbreak of H1N1 flu, a senior official wrote on the respected news Web site Ukrainska Pravda on Friday.

In an opinion piece Ihor Popov, the deputy head of President Viktor Yushchenko&apos;s secretariat, accused Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko&apos;s government of being taken unawares by a flu epidemic and said a state of emergency could be called.

Yushchenko and Tymoshenko have hurled bitter recriminations at each other over the past 18 months. Both will run in the first presidential election since the 2004 &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; swept the two former allies to power.

&quot;We hope that the government is able to manage the epidemic without a state of emergency,&quot; Popov wrote.

But he said measures already introduced such as a ban on public gatherings including political rallies raised questions about how fair an election would be.

&quot;With more than two months to voting, it is completely possible to overcome the first wave of the (H1N1) flu and avoid another wave,&quot; he wrote.

&quot;But should there be a state of emergency, the election would have to be delayed,&quot; he said, adding that May 30 would be an alternative date. The election is due to take place on Jan. 17, 2010.

Any state of emergency and election dates should be approved by parliament. But the constitution is not always absolutely clear on procedure and politicians can go to the constitutional court which can take weeks or months to review cases.

With public support at 5 percent or lower, Yushchenko is unlikely to win re-election. Tymoshenko and Viktor Yanukovich -- a former premier who was also the main loser in the Orange Revolution -- are both front-runners now.

Yushchenko this week called for the general prosecutor to investigate possible criminal negligence in the government&apos;s handling of the flu epidemic that has killed over 100 in recent weeks and infected over 750,000 in Ukraine.

Yushchenko said the other presidential candidates had organised mass political rallies despite knowing about the epidemic. The government introduced its measures just before he was due to hold his own rally in the capital. [ID:nL4279051]

Of the general flu cases, 32 are confirmed to be the H1N1 virus and three deaths have been registered from the virus. The World Health Organisation has said it assumes most cases of influenza in Ukraine are caused by the H1N1 strain. (Reporting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)</body>

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. health officials said on Friday they are making progress in improving the supply of H1N1 vaccine to state health departments and urged people frustrated by long lines and scarce supply not to give up.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said there are now twice as many doses of vaccine available as there were two weeks ago, with 38 million doses ordered or available for ordering by states.

The figure is still below the government&apos;s earlier estimate of 40 million doses available by the end of October, but Schuchat said the pace of progress is improving.

&quot;Today&apos;s number is up more than 11 million doses from last Friday&apos;s amount. That is progress. If all goes well, we&apos;re expecting about 8 million doses to be available in the week ahead,&quot; Schuchat told a news briefing.

The U.S. government initially projected that 20 million doses would roll out every week, but companies manufacturing them are producing only about 10 million doses a week or fewer, depending on when batches are ready.

The shortage of H1N1 vaccines has heaped pressure on public health departments across the country that must dole out the scare vaccine to groups at the highest risk from swine flu. Children and young people under age 24, pregnant women, healthcare workers and people with underlying health conditions are supposed to get the shots first.

The United States buys both seasonal and H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc, AstraZeneca Plc&apos;s MedImmune unit, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, and CSL Limited.

Robert Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health and colleagues found that only 5 percent of Americans they polled have been vaccinated against H1N1 so far.

LOW PERCENTAGE VACCINATED

Their nationally representative survey of 1,073 adults found that 17 percent of all adults and 41 percent of parents had tried to be vaccinated.

But just 21 percent of high-priority adults, such as asthma patients, have tried to be vaccinated. Of those who tried to get an H1N1 vaccine, 30 percent succeeded.

&quot;We still don&apos;t have enough vaccine. We know that communities are seeing lots of demand and the supply has hasn&apos;t caught up with that. We do need more, but we think we&apos;re moving toward a path of improvement at this point,&quot; Schuchat said.

The pandemic H1N1 virus has infected millions globally, with more than 5,000 documented deaths, including more than 1,000 Americans.

Schuchat said swine flu is still widespread in 48 states and she does not believe the pandemic has reached its peak, noting that flu season can last through May.

&quot;Most of the illness we are seeing is in younger people,&quot; she said. The latest count shows 129 children have been killed by the virus in the United States since April, up from 114 a week ago.

Two thirds of those deaths have been in people with underlying conditions such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and asthma.

On Thursday, New York City health officials scrambled to explain themselves in the wake of media reports that bankers got scarce H1N1 flu vaccines at work.

Schuchat said state and local health departments are best placed to make the decision about where the vaccine goes, but added, &quot;We work very closely with the states and have been emphasizing the priority populations.&quot;

(Recasts after WHO statement, adds new death toll)

GENEVA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - H1N1 swine flu is on the rise in China and Japan after triggering an unusually early start to the winter influenza season in Europe, Central Asia and North America, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

According to the U.N. agency&apos;s latest official toll, which is thought to underestimate the total spread of the virus, at least 6,071 people worldwide have died as a result of an H1N1 infection since its discovery earlier this year in Mexico and the United States.

Some 359 deaths were recorded in the past week, which saw a big outbreak in Ukraine as well as ongoing spread of the virus across the northern hemisphere.

&quot;Intense and persistent influenza transmission continues to be reported in North America without evidence of a peak in activity,&quot; the WHO said in its latest update.

&quot;In China, after an earlier wave of mixed influenza activity (seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1), pandemic H1N1 influenza activity now predominates and is increasing.&quot;

Sharp increases in pandemic flu infections continue to be reported throughout Japan, particularly on the northern island.

China is among more than 20 countries to have launched mass immunisation campaigns against the virus.

Most serious illness and deaths have occurred in patients younger than 65, and pregnant women and people with chronic health problems are at high risk.

The WHO&apos;s top flu expert Keiji Fukuda said on Thursday that pandemic vaccines given to millions of people had proved to be &quot;very safe,&quot; providing protection with no unusual side effects.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among some 25 companies producing pandemic vaccine and other drugmakers including Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding (ROG.VX) are making antivirals for use as a frontline H1N1 drug.

Some pigs, turkeys and household pets have become infected with the H1N1 flu, but the pandemic virus does not yet appear to be spreading quickly among animals, the WHO said. (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Matthew Jones)</body>

&quot;Intense and persistent influenza transmission continues to be reported in North America without evidence of a peak in activity,&quot; the WHO said in its latest update.

&quot;In China, after an earlier wave of mixed influenza activity (seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1), pandemic H1N1 influenza activity now predominates and is increasing.&quot;

Sharp increases in pandemic flu infections continue to be reported throughout Japan, particularly on the northern island.

China is among more than 20 countries to have launched mass immunization campaigns against the virus.

Most serious illness and deaths have occurred in patients younger than 65, and pregnant women and people with chronic health problems are at high risk.

The WHO&apos;s top flu expert Keiji Fukuda said on Thursday that pandemic vaccines given to millions of people had proved to be &quot;very safe,&quot; providing protection with no unusual side effects.

GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis are among some 25 companies producing pandemic vaccine and other drugmakers including Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding are making antivirals for use as a frontline H1N1 drug.

Some pigs, turkeys and household pets have become infected with the H1N1 flu, but the pandemic virus does not yet appear to be spreading quickly among animals, the WHO said.

* Owners urged to take care with sick animals

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - People who think they may have H1N1 flu need to stay away from work, avoid sneezing on their spouses and children and now, they have someone else to worry about infecting too -- their pets.

U.S. vets reported this week that a pet cat had been infected with the pandemic swine flu virus, apparently by its owners, who had reported flu-like illness in the days before.

Two pet ferrets also caught flu, again apparently from their owners, and several herds of pigs around the world have been reported infected.

Animals have long been known to be a source of new infections. Influenza itself originates in birds, possibly domestic ducks. AIDS appears to have come from chimpanzees and possibly gorillas. Ebola virus comes from bats while rabies is spread by many different species.

And this strain of H1N1 very likely originated in pigs although it is now infecting almost exclusively humans.

But with flu, at least, it can go the other way, too.

&quot;This is just another illustration of why influenza viruses are so tricky and frustrating and interesting at the same time, is this ability to occasionally jump species,&quot; said Dr. Carolyn Bridges of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Bridges said it is impossible to know how many pets may have been infected -- this particular cat lived near a sophisticated animal laboratory in Iowa where vets ran an influenza test out of curiosity. The good news is that the cat survived.

Even for people, it is difficult to find out if a fever, cough and stuffy nose was the swine flu or something else because ordinary flu tests can miss H1N1 and doctors do not have easy access to the more sophisticated test needed to diagnose it.

NO KISSING

So no one knows how often pets might get infected. But if there is a season for it to happen, this would be it, says Bridges.

&quot;We have a great deal more disease now than we have in a typical flu season,&quot; she said in a telephone interview.

&quot;With the higher numbers of infected people, that increases the possibility of seeing these transmissions.&quot;

Cats were known to get H5N1 avian influenza, which is still circulating and which has killed snow leopards and tigers that were fed infected chickens. A strain called H3N8 can sicken and kill pet dogs, Bridges added.

&quot;It is hypothesized that dogs got it from horses. There is potential, certainly, for cross-species infection,&quot; she said.

This is bad news for sick pet lovers.

&quot;Even though I think when I am sick in bed the best thing I can have is my cats piling in with me, we realize that is no longer a risk-free activity,&quot; said Dr. Julie Levy of the University of Florida, a specialist in pet diseases.

&quot;When a pet is sick we should use common sense -- wash hands, not let them kiss us in the face,&quot; Levy added.

According to the World Health Organization, H1N1 has killed at least 6,071 people worldwide and likely far more.

The Sweden-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control projects the virus could kill up to 40,000 people across Europe and be followed by seasonal flu waves that could kill the same number.

The international veterinary disease agency, the OIE, says it is compiling reports of H1N1 in animals.

&quot;It is very likely that there will be additional findings of other influenza strains,&quot; OIE Director Dr. Bernard Vallat said in a statement.

    <body>* Isolated animals including pets infected with H1N1 virus

* WHO says doctors and vets should work together to monitor

GENEVA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Some pigs, turkeys and household pets have become infected with the H1N1 flu, but the pandemic virus does not yet appear to be spreading quickly among animals, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said it was not clear how the isolated animals had contracted the flu virus that is spreading quickly among humans in the northern hemisphere, particularly in Eastern Europe. A novel flu virus -- looking like a mix of human and swine genes -- has been detected in some mink farms in Denmark, and seems to have infected only the animals and not the farm workers in proximity to them.

&quot;There were no human cases associated with the minks, but we don&apos;t know in some cases,&quot; Hartl said.

In a statement on its website, the United Nations health agency said the mink case &quot;demonstrates the constantly evolving ecology of influenza viruses, the potential for surprising changes, and the need for constant vigilance, also in animals.&quot;

&quot;These recent findings further suggest that influenza A viruses in animals and humans increasingly behave like a pool of genes circulating among multiple hosts, and that the potential exists for novel influenza viruses to be generated in animals other than swine,&quot; the WHO said.

The Geneva-based agency recommends that farm workers be monitored for signs of respiratory illness and is calling for close collaboration between public health and veterinary authorities in countries were outbreaks are rife.

According to the WHO&apos;s latest official toll, which is thought to underestimate the total spread of the virus, more than 5,700 people worldwide have died from H1N1 infection since its discovery earlier this year in North America.

Most patients experiencing serious effects have been younger than 65, differentiating the virus from seasonal influenza, which traditionally strikes the elderly.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among some 25 companies producing pandemic vaccine and other drugmakers including Switzerland&apos;s Roche Holding (ROG.VX) are making antiviral therapies for use as a frontline H1N1 drug. (Editing by Matthew Jones)</body>

By Lucy Hornby and Jargal Byambasuren

ULAN BATOR/BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation has shipped urgent supplies of the influenza drug Tamiflu to Mongolia, as the country&apos;s hospital system struggles to cope with a late but widespread outbreak of the H1N1 strain of flu.

Other Asian countries have begun vaccination programmes to help prevent the spread of H1N1, a new disease, but Mongolia has yet to receive its allotment of vaccines donated by wealthier nations and the spike in cases has hospitals struggling to cope.

The WHO sent over 45,000 doses of Tamiflu to Mongolia, which has had a rapid rise in reported cases of H1N1 since the first were detected in mid-October. The onset is tied to the start of winter, as Mongolians seal up their homes to keep out the cold.

Vaccine production has been slower than originally expected in the United States, delaying shipments to poorer countries [ID:nN27270273].

&quot;Already Mongolia&apos;s health system is quite strained, in terms of hospital capacity. The ministry is feeling the strain in terms of equipment, supplies and staff,&quot; said Dr Salik Govind, the officer in charge at the World Health Organisation in Mongolia.

&quot;It&apos;s a difficult challenge because people live in rural areas and health capacity at smaller hospitals is not as good as in larger ones.&quot;

Mongolia has confirmed 859 cases of H1N1 and six deaths, with cases reported in its far-flung aimags, or provinces, as well as the capital Ulan Bator.

It is allocating Tamiflu to high-risk patients, to allievate symptoms and reduce their likelihood of transmitting the disease. Mongolia previously had stockpiles of about 11,000 doses, half provided by the WHO in May.

The Mongolian government is now trying to buy additional vaccine doses, to supplement the 100,000 doses the WHO hopes to provide by the end of the year, Govind said.

Doctors in Ulan Bator said they had recommended anxious patients eat more horsemeat, to keep the winter flu at bay. Horsemeat prices have risen in the capital, where the government has also cancelled school and sports gatherings and shut cinemas for two weeks to slow the disease&apos;s spread [ID:nPEK164665].

While Mongolia struggles, H1N1 has brought success to Sinovac Biotech SVA.A, one of the designated vaccine producers in neighbouring China.

Sinovac plans to transfer its American Exchange-listed shares to the Nasdaq exchange, the China Daily said on Thursday.

Sinovac&apos;s shares rose by 7.6 times in the first eight months of this year, shortly before it announced that China had approved its vaccine production. They closed on Wednesday at $7.90 a share, up four and a half times from the beginning of 2009.

China&apos;s National Development and Reform Commission, the country&apos;s top planning body, warned on Thursday against charging fees for the H1N1 vaccine, which China is distributing for free.

It also warned schools against forcing children to receive other influenza vaccines for a fee, while dispensing the free H1N1 shots.

Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, authorities said two million people would receive H1N1 flu vaccinations from next month given the winter flu risk. Three million vaccination shots have been ordered from Sanofi-Aventis at a cost of around $30 million with high risk groups to be targeted in the voluntary scheme.

Hong Kong also said the human swine flu virus had been detected in pigs for the first time, though no reassortment of the virus had been found, with little extra risk seen to humans.

By Stephanie Nebehay

GENEVA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The H1N1 swine flu virus has picked up steam in the northern hemisphere and is expected to cause more serious infections and deaths as cold weather sets in, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday.

But the virus is not known to have mutated, including in people infected in a large outbreak in Ukraine, meaning that the current pandemic vaccines are expected to confer &quot;good protection&quot;, it said in a statement.

Mexico is reporting more H1N1 cases than early in the pandemic, which began in April, and the United States shows higher levels of flu-like illness than in past years, top WHO flu expert Keiji Fukuda said. Swine flu is also on the rise in Europe and Central Asia.

&quot;We anticipate seeing continued or increased activity during the winter period in the northern hemisphere. This also means that we expect to see continued reports of serious cases and deaths,&quot; Fukuda told a news conference. &quot;At WHO we remain quite concerned about the pattern that we are seeing.&quot;

Most people recover without specialised medical care for symptoms such as fever, cough and sore throat, but pregnant women and people with underlying chronic conditions like asthma are at higher risk of potentially fatal complications, he said.

At least 5,712 people worldwide have died from swine flu, which is now present in virtually every country, according to the United Nations agency. Most serious illness and fatalities occur in patients younger than 65, a different pattern to seasonal influenza, which traditionally strikes the elderly.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that as of Wednesday, some 500,000 cases of acute respiratory illness and 86 related deaths had been reported in Ukraine.

VACCINES SAFE

Pandemic vaccines given to millions of people in some 20 countries in recent weeks have shown them to be &quot;very safe&quot;, providing protection with no unusual side effects, Fukuda said.

However, the WHO has yet to receive some 200 million vaccine doses donated by 11 countries, which are intended for distribution in 95 poor countries lacking supplies, he said.

&quot;Vaccine companies out there are producing as much vaccine as quickly as possible. Much of the vaccine has been allocated to different countries on the basis of contracts,&quot; he added, referring to deals between drugmakers and governments.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among some 25 companies producing pandemic vaccine.

The known cases of resistance to antiviral drugs have been &quot;isolated and infrequent&quot;, according to Fukuda. [ID:nNWLA7419]

&quot;We see no evidence at all that there is widespread occurrence of antiviral resistance,&quot; he said.

Antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, marketed by Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding (ROG.VX) as Tamiflu, are considered the frontline drug against the H1N1 virus.

Norway&apos;s decision to allow over-the-counter sales of the drug so as to relieve stress on primary health-care systems appears to be &quot;innovative and prudent&quot;, Fukuda said.

H1N1 has caused a small number of infections in swine herds, turkeys in Chile and Canada and a few domestic pets in the United States, but these isolated events pose no special risks to human health, WHO said in the statement.

Norway&apos;s decision to allow over-the-counter sales of the drug so as to relieve stress on primary health-care systems appears to be &quot;innovative and prudent,&quot; Fukuda said.

H1N1 has caused a small number of infections in swine herds, turkeys in Chile and Canada and a few domestic pets in the United States, but these isolated events pose no special risks to human health, WHO said in the statement.

GENEVA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The H1N1 swine flu virus has picked up steam in the northern hemisphere and is expected to cause more serious infections and deaths as cold weather sets in, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday.

But the virus is not known to have mutated, including in people infected in a large outbreak in Ukraine, meaning that the current pandemic vaccines are expected to confer &quot;good protection&quot;, it said in a statement.

Mexico is reporting more H1N1 cases than early in the pandemic, which began in April, and the United States shows higher levels of flu-like illness than in past years, top WHO flu expert Keiji Fukuda said. Swine flu is also on the rise in Europe and Central Asia.

&quot;We anticipate seeing continued or increased activity during the winter period in the northern hemisphere. This also means that we expect to see continued reports of serious cases and deaths,&quot; Fukuda told a news conference. &quot;At WHO we remain quite concerned about the pattern that we are seeing.&quot;

Most people recover without specialised medical care for symptoms such as fever, cough and sore throat, but pregnant women and people with underlying chronic conditions like asthma are at higher risk of potentially fatal complications, he said.

At least 5,712 people worldwide have died from swine flu, which is now present in virtually every country, according to the United Nations agency. Most serious illness and fatalities occur in patients younger than 65, a different pattern to seasonal influenza, which traditionally strikes the elderly.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that as of Wednesday, some 500,000 cases of acute respiratory illness and 86 related deaths had been reported in Ukraine.

VACCINES SAFE

Pandemic vaccines given to millions of people in some 20 countries in recent weeks have shown them to be &quot;very safe&quot;, providing protection with no unusual side effects, Fukuda said.

However, the WHO has yet to receive some 200 million vaccine doses donated by 11 countries, which are intended for distribution in 95 poor countries lacking supplies, he said.

&quot;Vaccine companies out there are producing as much vaccine as quickly as possible. Much of the vaccine has been allocated to different countries on the basis of contracts,&quot; he added, referring to deals between drugmakers and governments.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among some 25 companies producing pandemic vaccine.

The known cases of resistance to antiviral drugs have been &quot;isolated and infrequent&quot;, according to Fukuda. [ID:nNWLA7419]

&quot;We see no evidence at all that there is widespread occurrence of antiviral resistance,&quot; he said.

Antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, marketed by Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding (ROG.VX) as Tamiflu, are considered the frontline drug against the H1N1 virus.

Norway&apos;s decision to allow over-the-counter sales of the drug so as to relieve stress on primary health-care systems appears to be &quot;innovative and prudent&quot;, Fukuda said.

By Bill Berkrot

NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - New York City health officials scrambled to explain themselves on Thursday following outraged media reports about bankers who got scarce H1N1 flu vaccines through their employers.

Members of Congress fired off letters demanding immediate explanations and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminded state and city health officers of the need to make sure the most vulnerable people get shots first.

&quot;I am concerned that the distribution of the vaccine is resulting in favored treatment for the privileged,&quot; New Jersey Democratic Representative Frank Pallone said.

The shortage of H1N1 vaccines has frayed nerves, and public health departments across the country say they will not be able to meet the bulk of the demand until December or January.

The CDC estimates swine flu has infected more than 5 million people and it is documented as having killed 1,000.

The federal government, which is buying the vaccines and distributing them for free to 62 state and city health departments, says 35.6 million doses have been made and packaged since production began.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd released a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius saying he was &quot;stunned&quot;.

&quot;I implore you to use whatever authorities you have to ensure that H1N1 vaccines already distributed but not yet used are promptly redirected to hospitals, schools, community health clinics, school-based health clinics, and pediatricians so that they can be made immediately available to at-risk members of the public as identified by the Department,&quot; Dodd wrote.

CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden sent out a reminder to state and city health departments, which distribute vaccine.

&quot;I ask each of you to review your plans immediately and work to ensure that the maximum number of doses is delivered to those at greatest risk as rapidly as possible,&quot; he wrote.

&quot;I especially appreciate the many innovative ways you&apos;ve found to reach them, including school-located vaccine clinics, special clinics for pregnant women, outreach to children with special needs, and making vaccine available to community- and faith-based organizations serving these high-risk populations.&quot;

Close to 160 million people are in the priority groups to get vaccine first -- healthcare workers, pregnant women, children and adults under 65 with medical conditions, caregivers for infants too young to be vaccinated and people 24 and younger.

&quot;When H1N1 vaccine first became available in the fall, we directed all available doses to pediatricians, OB-GYNs, community health centers, public and private hospitals,&quot; New York City health department spokeswoman Jessica Scaperotti said in a telephone interview.

&quot;As more vaccine became available we started to place small orders to providers that serve adults, including employee health centers.&quot;

She said the city had given 800,000 doses to about 1,100 providers, with Lenox Hill Hospital, for example, getting 1,200 doses and banker Goldman Sachs (GS.N) getting 200 of the 5,300 doses it asked for, Scaperotti said.

She said 16 of the city&apos;s 25 biggest employers had vaccine, including Columbia University, Citi Group (C.N) and others, as well as the Federal Reserve Bank, which is not among the top 25 employers.

    <summary>... Patient volumes at the not-for-profit hospital are beginning to rise once again as a second wave of the H1N1 flu pandemic -- which has killed 1,000 Americans ...</summary>
    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Last May, an influx of children with flu symptoms and their worried families flooded the emergency department of Children&apos;s Memorial Hospital in Chicago, swelling the normal patient load from 150 a day to 400 and leaving a net loss for the month of $325,000.

Patient volumes at the not-for-profit hospital are beginning to rise once again as a second wave of the H1N1 flu pandemic -- which has killed 1,000 Americans and more than 5,700 people globally -- works its way through the Northern Hemisphere.

&quot;At this point in the year, we would expect to see around 180 patients a day. We&apos;re seeing around 250 patients a day,&quot; Donald Camp, an administrator at the hospital, said.

&quot;We are watching our volumes closely, but to date we have weathered this all right,&quot; Camp said in a phone interview.

Wall Street analysts and academic experts say so far the H1N1 pandemic has had a mild impact on hospitals in the United States, and will likely fall far short of the most dire predictions of hospitals chock full of patients admitted with severe cases of flu.

Dr. Eric Toner of Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said a severe flu pandemic like the one in 1918 could cost U.S. hospitals $3.9 billion, but he expects this pandemic to have far less impact.

&quot;So far, it has not been overwhelming. Just a stretch,&quot; Toner said in a telephone interview.

HOSPITALS WORRIED

A report by Trust for America&apos;s Health last month suggested as many as 15 states could run out of hospital beds and 12 more could fill 75 percent of their beds with swine flu sufferers if 35 percent of Americans catch the virus.

Lazard Capital Markets analyst Thomas Gallucci, who follows publicly traded hospitals, said based on quarterly results reported so far, that&apos;s not happening.

&quot;Although you are seeing more ER activity, you are not seeing really a high percentage of people get admitted to the hospital,&quot; he said.

But manufacturing problems that have slowed distribution of swine flu vaccines and steadily rising emergency department volumes do have hospitals worried.

&quot;Already, with this increase in volume we have implemented some additional staffing plans for our nurses. We&apos;ve brought in additional housekeepers. We&apos;ve added additional security for crowd control,&quot; Mary Margaret Crulcich, safety officer at Children&apos;s Memorial, said in a telephone interview.

Scott Rosenstein, a global health analyst at Eurasia Group in New York, said U.S. hospitals in general are operating at surge capacity, and a lot will depend on the government&apos;s ability to resolve problems delivering both H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.

Federal health officials said this week that states and counties will be struggling to vaccinate people against the swine flu pandemic well into December and January -- long after the first peak of the virus in the United States.

&quot;Overall, I think the hospital situation is still relatively tenuous. It remains to be seen what will happen,&quot; Rosenstein said.

&quot;If seasonal flu comes back as it typically does in January or February along side a pandemic H1N1 outbreak that is still continuing to increase, obviously the strain will be considerably worse.&quot;

&quot;We never thought we would receive doses ahead of area hospitals and once this was brought to our attention, we promptly donated the doses we received to a few area hospitals,&quot; including Morgan Stanley Children&apos;s Hospital in New York, a company spokeswoman said.

* Government warns against false H1N1 cures

* Flu spreading at faster pace

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Close to 6 million Canadians, or about 18 percent of the population, will be vaccinated against H1N1 flu by early next week, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer said on Thursday.

&quot;There&apos;s an awful lot of Canadians out there that will be protected going forward, more and more and millions more every week from now on,&quot; Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, told a news conference in Ottawa.

The governments of Canada&apos;s provinces and territories are responsible for immunizing residents after the federal government delivers the vaccine.

Butler-Jones did not directly comment on a story in Thursday&apos;s Globe and Mail newspaper that said more than half of the vaccine doses the federal government has distributed are sitting in storage because provincial governments aren&apos;t ready to use them.

&quot;Pandemics are full of surprises,&quot; Butler-Jones said. &quot;That first week (of vaccinations) was going to be messy. It&apos;s like any emergency, it&apos;s unpredictable.&quot;

The flu&apos;s spread is accelerating, Butler-Jones said, with the number of new hospitalizations, people admitted to intensive care units and deaths triple what it was last week.

The provinces will have 6.5 million doses of vaccine by Friday, with another 2 million doses arriving next week, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said.

Criticism of public health officials has been building because of long lineups for vaccinations, shortages in some provinces and news this week that the Calgary Flames National Hockey League team got its shots ahead of the general public.

GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK.L) is Canada&apos;s sole supplier of the vaccine.

A second type of vaccine recommended for pregnant women and supplied by Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd (CSL.AX) is now available, Aglukkaq said.

Health officials repeated a warning that people should avoid supposed cures for the H1N1 flu that are circulating on the Internet. (Editing by Peter Galloway)</body>

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City health officials scrambled to explain themselves on Thursday following outraged media reports about bankers who got scarce H1N1 flu vaccines through their employers.

Although there is a longstanding arrangement for employers to provide seasonal flu shots to workers, the city health department was bombarded with calls and television reports about Wall Street workers jumping the line ahead of pregnant women and children.

&quot;It&apos;s bad enough that Wall Street crashed our economy and is back to paying out platinum bonuses after taking trillions in taxpayer-funded bailouts and backstops,&quot; Service Employees International Union Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger said in a statement.

&quot;But purposely endangering the health of millions of Americans during a public health crisis crosses all lines of decency.&quot;

The shortage of H1N1 vaccines has frayed some nerves, and public health departments across the country say they will not be able to meet the bulk of the demand until December or January.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates swine flu has infected more than 5 million people and it is documented as having killed 1,000.

The federal government, which is buying the vaccines and distributing them for free to 62 state and city health departments, says 35.6 million doses have been made and packaged since production began.

Close to 160 million people are in the priority groups to get vaccine first -- healthcare workers, pregnant women, children and adults under 65 with medical conditions, caregivers for infants too young to be vaccinated and people 24 and younger.

New York City health department spokeswoman Jessica Scaperotti said the city is working to distribute the vaccine widely.

&quot;When H1N1 vaccine first became available in the fall, we directed all available doses to pediatricians, OB-GYNs, community health centers, public and private hospitals,&quot; she said in a telephone interview.

EMPLOYEE HEALTH CENTERS

&quot;As more vaccine became available we started to place small orders to providers that serve adults, including employee health centers.&quot;

She said the city had given 800,000 doses to about 1,100 providers, with Lenox Hill Hospital, for example, getting 1,200 doses and banker Goldman Sachs getting 200 of the 5,300 doses it asked for, Scaperotti said.

&quot;To put in context, if you look at the 25 largest employers in New York City, about 16 of them have received vaccine,&quot; Scaperotti said.

They include Columbia University, New York University, New York Presbyterian Healthcare System, Citi Group and others, as well as the Federal Reserve Bank, which is not among the top 25 employers.

She said public hospitals have received 8 percent of the available vaccines, private hospitals about 13 percent and 39 percent was set aside for school vaccination programs.

Employee health centers must sign an agreement that they will only administer the vaccine to those in identified high risk groups, Scaperotti said.

The CDC planned to send out a letter later on Thursday reminding vaccinating centers who the priority groups are.

&quot;Goldman Sachs, like other responsible employers, has requested vaccine and will supply it only to employees who qualify based on the requirements identified by the CDC and Department of Health,&quot; the company said in a statement. Citi released a similar pledge.

    <summary>... &quot;When we had the initial H1N1 scare back in the spring, the county and state health departments were absolutely overwhelmed with the volume of calls and tests ...</summary>
    <body>By Lucas Mearian - Computerworld

Dr. Chris Crow, a family physician in Plano, Texas, said that in 10 years of practicing medicine, he&apos;s never seen flu spread like it has in the past six weeks. Crow said he has been treating at least three new flu patients a day over that time.

&quot;It has been absolutely incredible watching this,&quot; said Crow, who runs Village Health Partners, a practice with 10 physicians. &quot;When we had the initial H1N1 scare back in the spring, the county and state health departments were absolutely overwhelmed with the volume of calls and tests being reported to them.&quot;

At that time, county and state officials were so overwhelmed, they told doctors to stop sending in test results because they couldn&apos;t handle the volume, Crow said. But, that changed this week when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched an effort to better and more easily track for H1N1, or Swine Flu , and other seasonal influenza activity throughout the United States.

The CDC said it is now tracking data on 14 million patients from physician practices and hospitals that is stored on a relational database hosted by GE Healthcare , General Electric Co.&apos;s health care division. The data is submitted daily from physician&apos;s offices and hospitals that use GE&apos;s electronic medical record (EMR) system. The data is then uploaded to GE Healthcare&apos;s Medical Quality Improvement Consortium (MQIC), a database repository designed with HIPAA-compliance parameters of patient anonymity and best practices where it can be the subject of medical data queries.

The CDC can perform queries to look for flu-like symptoms being reported by physicians, and then disseminate the data for health care providers and local government officials throughout the country, who can alert businesses and others about flu outbreak hot spots.

The CDC also hopes its analysis of the data helps it better understand the characteristics of H1N1 outbreaks and to determine who is most at risk for developing complications from the virus.

Prior to implementing the new system, the CDC relied heavily on tracking insurance claims data, which could take days, if not weeks, to make its way to the agency&apos;s medical staff for analysis.

&quot;You not only want to get the data from here to there, but then you also have to say I need to normalize that data,&quot; said Dr. Mark Dente, chief medical informatics officer for GE Healthcare IT. &quot;For example, if one doctor says hypertension, another says HTN and someone else says high blood pressure, it all means the same thing when you enter a query against the data.&quot;

According to the CDC&apos;s Office of Program Grant Officials, the CDC selected GE Healthcare&apos;s system for the project due to the database&apos;s built-in reporting capabilities.

The CDC has traditionally compiled data collected from insurance claims, a process that can take weeks or months to complete.

Crow&apos;s practice has used GE&apos;s Centricity electronic medical record system , for six years, so when the CDC program was launched he was automatically allowed access to the query engine that accessed data on the patents in the national GE records program.

Like Crow, all participating physicians automatically contribute data collected during patient cisits to MQIC each day through normal use of GE&apos;s Centricity EMR system. The information aggregated by MQIC has no personal patient information, so patient privacy is not an issue.

Crow said he has been using MQIC aggregated data to give his own physicians feedback based on evidence-based guidelines and benchmarks provided by the National Committee of Quality Assurances - a standardization organization for clinical care for disease management.

Crow said now that the CDC also has access to the MQIC database, they will be able to track clinical symptoms such as fever, nausea and chills, prescriptions written, and vaccination rates, as well as variables such as procedures performed, pregnancy and patient age, within 24 hours of being compiled in thousands of participating doctors&apos; offices across the country.

&quot;This is monumental because they&apos;re taking my and other doctor&apos;s data every day and looking for clues for new flu cases, such as fever ... diagnosing codes and testing results,&quot; Crow said. &quot;This is going to allow the CDC to have the daily update for what&apos;s going on for 14 million patients, which is what, 14% of the country?&quot;

Once the CDC can spot regional upticks in flu cases, it can then send out alerts to physicians and businesses signed up for CDC flu alerts who can then take precautions against spreading the illness, Dente said.

&quot;In terms of physicians, at the very beginning this allows you to suspect the flu before you otherwise might. From a patient standpoint, it alerts them to come in sooner. Getting in sooner can help the symptoms as well as the duration of the illness by using anti-virals that are out there today,&quot; Crow said.

    <body>* Vaccine recommended for pregnant women ready this week

* Government warns against false H1N1 cures

* Flu spreading at faster pace

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Close to 6 million Canadians, or about 18 percent of the population, will be vaccinated against H1N1 flu by early next week, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer said on Thursday.

&quot;There&apos;s an awful lot of Canadians out there that will be protected going forward, more and more and millions more every week from now on,&quot; Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, told a news conference in Ottawa.

The governments of Canada&apos;s provinces and territories are responsible for immunizing residents after the federal government delivers the vaccine.

Butler-Jones did not directly comment on a story in Thursday&apos;s Globe and Mail newspaper that said more than half of the vaccine doses the federal government has distributed are sitting in storage because provincial governments aren&apos;t ready to use them.

&quot;Pandemics are full of surprises,&quot; Butler-Jones said. &quot;That first week (of vaccinations) was going to be messy. It&apos;s like any emergency, it&apos;s unpredictable.&quot;

The flu&apos;s spread is accelerating, Butler-Jones said, with the number of new hospitalizations, people admitted to intensive care units and deaths triple what it was last week.

The provinces will have 6.5 million doses of vaccine by Friday, with another 2 million doses arriving next week, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said.

Criticism of public health officials has been building because of long lineups for vaccinations, shortages in some provinces and news this week that the Calgary Flames National Hockey League team got its shots ahead of the general public.

GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK.L) is Canada&apos;s sole supplier of the vaccine.

A second type of vaccine recommended for pregnant women and supplied by Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd (CSL.AX) is now available, Aglukkaq said.

Health officials repeated a warning that people should avoid supposed cures for the H1N1 flu that are circulating on the Internet. (Editing by Peter Galloway)</body>

    <body>ZURICH, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Germany has approved Novartis AG&apos;s (NOVN.VX) H1N1 swin flu vaccine Celtura, the Swiss drugmaker said on Thursday.

Novartis, whose other H1N1 vaccine, Focetria, recently received backing in Switzerland, said it would continue to seek registration in other major countries including Japan and Switzerland.

Celtura can be used to vaccinate people from six months and older against the H1N1 virus.

Novartis has already started to ship doses of its vaccines Fluvirin to the US, and Focetria to countries around the world.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved the Fluvirin in September, while the EMEA approved the Focetria vaccine on September 29, 2009.

NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - New York City health officials scrambled to explain themselves on Thursday following outraged media reports about bankers who got scarce H1N1 flu vaccines through their employers.

    <body>LAGOS, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Nigeria, Africa&apos;s most populous nation, said late on Wednesday it had recorded its first case of H1N1 swine flu in a 9-year old girl from the United States living in the commercial hub of Lagos.

The health ministry said the girl, who had symptoms including fever, sore throat and nausea, had fully recovered after 5 days and that while her mother also had mild symptoms, no other family members or school pupils were affected.

&quot;We want to reassure all Nigerians that there is no need to panic,&quot; the ministry said, adding that all of the country&apos;s 36 states had been given adequate supplies of the antiviral drug Tamiflu.

The H1N1 pandemic strain passes easily from person to person and has infected millions globally since March, killing at least 5,000 people whose infections have been documented, according to the World Health Organisation.

Medical experts say the prevalence of illnesses such as tuberculosis and malaria in many parts of Africa, combined with a lack of adequate healthcare in rural areas, could mask the spread of swine flu.

INCHEON, South Korea, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Heads of members of a major airline alliance including Korean Air and Delta Airlines expressed some optimism about the industry&apos;s recovery but noted uncertainties from the H1N1 flu virus and the overall economy.

Airlines around the world have been hit by soft travel demand and low fares after last year&apos;s crisis, but are seeing a stabilising trend.

Stronger airlines are set to benefit from the ongoing recovery by scooping up smaller rivals in trouble.

&quot;We expect a significant recovery for (the rest of) this year and next year,&quot; said Cho Yang-ho, chief executive of South Korea&apos;s top airline Korean Air (003490.KS), adding that the recovering won KRW= and more stable oil prices were helping.

&quot;Once things go down, they go up too...Asia has shown the fastest recovery in the world,&quot; Cho said.

But he warned that the spread of the H1N1 flu virus was adding uncertainty to the industry outlook.

When asked about its cargo business, ranked top worldwide, Cho said: &quot;It keeps growing.&quot;

Cho and other airline executives were speaking to a news conference held in South Korea following a governing board meeting of the SkyTeam alliance.

&quot;As we look at global airline booking trends, we have seen steady improvements since June of 2009,&quot; said Richard Anderson, chief executive of the world&apos;s biggest Delta Airlines (DAL.N).

&quot;The recovery is still difficult in the global economy and will not be rapid or smooth necessarily. But we are seeing positive improvements in loads, yields and business travellers.&quot;

Airlines saw demand suffer especially in the highly profitable business class segment this year as companies cut costs.

Anderson declined to elaborate when asked about Delta&apos;s approach to Japan Airlines (JAL) (9205.T), Asia&apos;s largest airline by revenue.

Financially troubled JAL has held separate talks about business ties and possible capital injections with AMR Corp&apos;s (AMR.N) American Airlines and Delta.

Separately, the chairman of China Southern (1055.HK), China&apos;s top air carrier by fleet size, said he was confident about the Chinese airline market outlook.

Chairman Si Xianmin said China had seen healthy growth in passengers so far this year and that he was &quot;confident on the prospect of the Chinese market.&quot;

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Close to 6 million Canadians, or about 18 percent of the population, will be vaccinated against H1N1 flu by early next week, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer said on Thursday.

&quot;There&apos;s an awful lot of Canadians out there that will be protected going forward, more and more and millions more every week from now on,&quot; Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, told a news conference in Ottawa.

The governments of Canada&apos;s provinces and territories are responsible for immunizing residents after the federal government delivers the vaccine.

Butler-Jones did not directly comment on a story in Thursday&apos;s Globe and Mail newspaper that said more than half of the vaccine doses the federal government has distributed are sitting in storage because provincial governments aren&apos;t ready to use them.

&quot;Pandemics are full of surprises,&quot; Butler-Jones said. &quot;That first week (of vaccinations) was going to be messy. It&apos;s like any emergency, it&apos;s unpredictable.&quot;

The flu&apos;s spread is accelerating, Butler-Jones said, with the number of new hospitalizations, people admitted to intensive care units and deaths triple what it was last week.

The provinces will have 6.5 million doses of vaccine by Friday, with another 2 million doses arriving next week, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said.

Criticism of public health officials has been building because of long lineups for vaccinations, shortages in some provinces and news this week that the Calgary Flames National Hockey League team got its shots ahead of the general public.

GlaxoSmithKline PLC is Canada&apos;s sole supplier of the vaccine.

A second type of vaccine recommended for pregnant women and supplied by Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd is now available, Aglukkaq said.

Health officials repeated a warning that people should avoid supposed cures for the H1N1 flu that are circulating on the Internet.

    <body>CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Senior health officials in the Canadian province of Alberta said on Wednesday they had fired an unidentified worker for giving National Hockey League players preferential access to the H1N1 flu vaccine.

The controversy boiled over this week when it was revealed that players for the NHL&apos;s Calgary Flames and their families received shots on an exclusive basis one day before the province closed public flu clinics due to a shortage of the vaccine.

&quot;Our policies on vaccine distribution are designed to ensure an equitable distribution of the vaccine to all Albertans,&quot; Alberta Health Services Chief Executive Stephen Duckett said in a statement.

&quot;The special treatment for the Flames and their families is unacceptable to us and contrary to all of our existing protocols and processes. I apologize for this breach of our duty to Albertans.&quot;

Public outrage over the revelations showed that Canadians&apos; love for a hockey team, even when it includes such franchise stars as forward Jarome Iginla and goaltender Mikka Kiprusoff, only goes so far during a pandemic.

The health agency said it was continuing its investigation and more disciplinary action could be taken.

The flap over the Flames topped a chaotic several days for mass vaccination in the province of 3.5 million residents that started with hours-long queues at makeshift clinics and ended with the abrupt halt to H1N1 shots when far more people than expected showed up for them.

The Alberta authority said it would restart shots for higher-risk people such as young children and pregnant women, but it will keep vaccine from the general public for now.

* Raises outlook for fiscal 2010

* Sees &quot;moderate improvement&quot; in hospital capex

* Shares rally 7.4 percent to a record

CHICAGO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - CareFusion Corp (CFN.N), the medical device company spun off from Cardinal Health (CAH.N) on Sept. 1, posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by strong demand in ventilators for flu and emergency preparedness related to H1N1, or swine flu.

The company also increased its outlook for the full year to earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.45 from its previous forecast of $1.10 to $1.20, on revenue of $3.85 billion to $4.00 billion.

CareFusion shares rallied 7.4 percent to a record $24.22 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Management reiterated its long-term goals for top-line growth in the mid-single digits and profit growth from 11 to 15 percent.

CareFusion said its fiscal first-quarter net earnings were $81 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, on revenue of $923 million. In the year-ago period, had CareFusion been operating as a stand-alone company, earnings would have been $113 million, or 51 cents per share, on revenue of $915 million.

Excluding one-time spinoff and other items, earnings per share were 39 cents, in the latest quarter, exceeding the average estimate on Wall Street of 33 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

&quot;We continue to see moderate improvement in the nearly year-long deferral of capital spending,&quot; Chairman and Chief Executive David Schlotterbeck told a conference call.

&quot;But we expect the recovery will be gradual with capital spending constrained through this fiscal year. We expect our quarterly revenue will exceed first quarter results as we move through the year, but the year-over-year comparisons in the first half will be challenging because of the strong growth we had in the first half of last year,&quot; he added.

    <body>* Majority not assured but Tories would be reelected

* Poll numbers close to 2008 election results

* Pollster says Liberals need something to inspire voters

OTTAWA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Canada&apos;s governing Conservatives no longer have enough popular support to be assured of a majority government if an election were held now but would easily regain another minority, an Ekos poll showed on Thursday.

Their lead over the Liberal Party, the biggest opposition party, has dropped to a little more than 10 points, enough to win reelection handily but down from the 15-point edge they had three weeks ago.

The current standings almost exactly mirror the results from the October 2008 election, when the Liberals went down to their worst showing, in terms of percentage of vote, in more than a century.

&quot;From the Liberal perspective, these results must be deeply troubling. Despite a new leader, and party coffers refilling, the Liberals are not competitive for government at the moment,&quot; Ekos President Frank Graves said. &quot;They desperately need something to shake up the current pattern of support.&quot;

He added that it might be mildly encouraging for the Liberals that the gap has shrunk. They have attacked the Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, over the government&apos;s handling of the H1N1 flu vaccine campaign and the injection of stimulus measures into the economy.

The Conservatives have 37.4 percent of popular support in the poll, down one point from last week and more than three points less than three weeks ago.

The Liberals were at 26.8 percent support, approximately where they have been for a month.

&quot;This is the repetition of a disappointing pattern from Stephen Harper&apos;s perspective. Whenever the Tories surge up into majority territory as they did a few weeks ago, they soon find themselves slipping back, as they have done now,&quot; Graves said.

The Liberals had been roughly tied with the Conservatives for most of the summer but fell sharply behind after they decided in early September to try to bring the government down and force a new election.

It now is all but certain that the government will stay in power for the next several months, with the support of the small New Democratic Party.

The New Democrats stand at 16.3 percent support in the Ekos survey, marginally less than a week ago and two points less than their electoral result in 2008. The Greens are at 10.0 percent and the separatist Bloc Quebecois at 9.4 percent.

The automated telephone survey of 3,327 Canadians was carried out from Oct. 28 to Nov. 3. Such a sample size should be accurate to within 1.7 points 19 times out of 20. (Reporting by Randall Palmer; editing by Peter Galloway)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - States and counties will be struggling to vaccinate people against the swine flu pandemic well into December and January -- long after the first peak of the virus in the United States, officials said on Wednesday.

Federal health officials also said it will be years before things get any better, despite years of planning.

&quot;It is likely that the current wave of infections will peak, crest and then decline before full vaccine supplies are delivered,&quot; Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a House of Representatives Appropriations subcommittee.

The briefing painted a picture of the problems dogging health departments at the height of the pandemic, which has killed at least 1,000 Americans and more than 5,700 people globally.

&quot;Our school-based vaccination efforts have now been delayed until late November or early December,&quot; Dr. Donald Williamson of the Alabama Department of Public Health told the briefing -- not a formal Congressional hearing.

&quot;Current projections show that 62 percent of Alabama&apos;s vaccine will not be available until after December 1.&quot; That means providers could wait until January to get vaccines.

Frieden said the CDC has now delivered or has available 32.2 million doses of swine flu vaccine and wants to ensure it is not wasted.

&quot;We don&apos;t want people turned away and told to come back, because they may not come back in the future,&quot; he said.

Rob Fulton of St. Paul Ramsey County in Minnesota said the delays will hit other programs.

&quot;We are very concerned should we have another emergency event such as a large-scale food-borne outbreak or a tuberculosis outbreak that requires diverting staff,&quot; he told the subcommittee, which helps decide on public health funding.

&quot;Local and state funding for public health has been impacted by the poor economy and we have just eliminated 5 percent of our staff to meet our 2010 budget goals.&quot;

Only 7,800 doses of vaccine will be available for children of 9 and under, but the county has 20,000 such children.

&quot;We know that the credibility of the entire public health system is in question due to the slow arrival of H1N1 vaccine,&quot; Fulton said.

Both committee chairman David Obey of Wisconsin and Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut noted that they have been holding hearings for years about the lack of public health infrastructure in the United States and the need for better vaccine manufacturing capacity for a pandemic.

&quot;I have been hearing this stuff for five years,&quot; Obey said, even reading aloud from old testimony.

&quot;How do we adequately prepare and have the infrastructure in place to manufacture and distribute vaccine wherever something comes up?&quot; asked DeLauro.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said preparations have not been at a standstill.

&quot;We have gone from 2003, when our budget for influenza was $50 million. It is now $260 million at a time when the NIH (National Institutes of Health) budget was flat,&quot; he said.

NIAID is funding research to make and test new antiviral drugs and to improve vaccines.

&quot;The aim is to get what&apos;s called a universal vaccine. Then you could make as much as you want, Fauci said, noting that is years away because research and testing takes time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Swine flu has driven up the price of horse meat in Mongolia, closed schools across Afghanistan and Ukraine and sparked a quarrel over whether detainees at a U.S. base in Cuba should be vaccinated.

As infections accelerated across the northern half of the world, Saudi authorities approved a vaccine ahead of the annual haj pilgrimage and U.S. members of Congress proposed legislation to force employers to pay for sick leave.

The pandemic H1N1 virus has infected millions globally, with more than 5,000 documented deaths and likely far more.

A study published Tuesday added to the growing body of knowledge about the virus, confirming that while it rarely infects people over 65, once it does it is as deadly to them as seasonal flu is.

In Mongolia, the government closed kindergartens, extended a holiday for secondary schools and canceled sports and cultural events, the English-language UB Post newspaper reported.

Worried Mongolians spread the rumor that eating horse meat might stave off the disease, pushing up prices.

In South Korea, where 42 deaths have been confirmed, health authorities raised the epidemic alert to the highest level. Nearly 400 schools have closed voluntarily.

The Saudi Food and Drug Authority approved one of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s vaccines for the H1N1 swine flu virus on Tuesday, as the kingdom gears up for more than 2 million visitors at next month&apos;s haj, the annual pilgrimage undertaken by many observant Muslims.

SUBSTANTIAL ACTIVITY

Afghanistan declared a health emergency and ordered schools closed for three weeks. The government has also advised the public against gatherings such as weddings in enclosed areas.

&quot;There is substantial influenza activity and we would expect to see more. Certainly the indications are that this will become something quite widespread across the northern hemisphere temperate zones as we go forward through the late autumn and winter,&quot; the World Health Organization&apos;s Gregory Hartl said.

In the United States, a member of Congress proposed emergency legislation that would require employers who tell workers to stay home when they are sick to give them paid time off for up to five days.

Health officials have been urging anyone with flu-like symptoms such as cough and fever to stay home, but up to 50 million Americans risk a day&apos;s pay and perhaps their jobs if they do.

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that 11 percent of people who were hospitalized in California died, but among people 50 and older, 18 to 20 percent died.

The most common causes of death were viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the researchers found, and as with other studies, obesity appeared to play a significant role in the severity of disease.

Americans have been struggling to find H1N1 vaccines, with only 30 million doses available to protect a population 10 times that size.

VACCINATING PRISONERS

The White House denied that any H1N1 flu vaccine is now going to terrorism suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba after members of Congress and some media commentators complained, but a Department of Defense spokesman said the vaccine would be offered to about 200 Guantanamo detainees.

After months of talks, the largest U.S. nurses union and California&apos;s biggest nonprofit healthcare chain agreed to safeguards that the nurses believe may serve as a national model for curbing H1N1 swine flu in hospitals and averting a one-day strike threatened by thousands of registered nurses at more than 30 hospitals.

Swine flu fears helped fuel strong sales of disinfecting products. Clorox Co posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast.

&quot;H1N1, that&apos;s the name of the game,&quot; said UBS analyst Nik Modi. &quot;That&apos;s what really helped them with the upside.&quot;

The U.S. Department of Agriculture found the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in a commercial swine herd in Indiana as federal agencies stepped up their hunt for the virus in pigs. It has been found in herds in Canada and Britain as well.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - States and counties will be struggling to vaccinate people against the swine flu pandemic well into December and January -- long after the first peak of the virus in the United States, officials said on Wednesday.

Federal health officials also said it will be years before things get any better, despite years of planning.

&quot;It is likely that the current wave of infections will peak, crest and then decline before full vaccine supplies are delivered,&quot; Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a House of Representatives Appropriations subcommittee.

The briefing painted a picture of the problems dogging health departments at the height of the pandemic, which has killed at least 1,000 Americans and more than 5,700 people globally.

&quot;Our school-based vaccination efforts have now been delayed until late November or early December,&quot; Dr. Donald Williamson of the Alabama Department of Public Health told the briefing -- not a formal Congressional hearing.

&quot;Current projections show that 62 percent of Alabama&apos;s vaccine will not be available until after December 1.&quot; That means providers could wait until January to get vaccines.

Frieden said the CDC has now delivered or has available 32.2 million doses of swine flu vaccine and wants to ensure it is not wasted.

&quot;We don&apos;t want people turned away and told to come back, because they may not come back in the future,&quot; he said.

Rob Fulton of St. Paul Ramsey County in Minnesota said the delays will hit other programs.

&quot;We are very concerned should we have another emergency event such as a large-scale food-borne outbreak or a tuberculosis outbreak that requires diverting staff,&quot; he told the subcommittee, which helps decide on public health funding.

STAFF CUTS

&quot;Local and state funding for public health has been impacted by the poor economy and we have just eliminated 5 percent of our staff to meet our 2010 budget goals.&quot;

Only 7,800 doses of vaccine will be available for children of 9 and under, but the county has 20,000 such children.

&quot;We know that the credibility of the entire public health system is in question due to the slow arrival of H1N1 vaccine,&quot; Fulton said.

Both committee chairman David Obey of Wisconsin and Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut noted that they have been holding hearings for years about the lack of public health infrastructure in the United States and the need for better vaccine manufacturing capacity for a pandemic.

&quot;I have been hearing this stuff for five years,&quot; Obey said, even reading aloud from old testimony.

&quot;How do we adequately prepare and have the infrastructure in place to manufacture and distribute vaccine wherever something comes up?&quot; asked DeLauro.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said preparations have not been at a standstill.

&quot;We have gone from 2003, when our budget for influenza was $50 million. It is now $260 million at a time when the NIH (National Institutes of Health) budget was flat,&quot; he said.

NIAID is funding research to make and test new antiviral drugs and to improve vaccines.

    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A cat in Iowa has tested positive for H1N1 swine flu, the first time a cat has been diagnosed with the new pandemic strain, the American Veterinary Medical Association said on Wednesday.

The 13-year-old cat apparently caught the virus from one of the people living in the house, the group said in a statement. It has recovered and does not appear to have infected anyone or anything else.

Pigs are the original source of the H1N1 virus and it has been found in several herds, as well as in a pet ferret. Ferrets are especially susceptible to human influenza viruses.

&quot;Two of the three members of the family that owns the pet had suffered from influenza-like illness before the cat became ill,&quot; Iowa Department of Public Health Veterinarian Dr. Ann Garvey said in a statement.

&quot;This is not completely unexpected, as other strains of influenza have been found in cats in the past.&quot; Both the cat and its owners have recovered from their illnesses.

The AVMA has a website on H1N1 illnesses in U.S. animals at www.avma.org/public_health/influenza/new_virus. Dogs and horses also can catch various influenza strains, although none have so far been diagnosed with H1N1.

&quot;Indoor pets that live in close proximity to someone who has been sick are at risk and it is wise to monitor their health to ensure they aren&apos;t showing signs of illness,&quot; said Dr. David Schmitt, state veterinarian for Iowa.

The new H1N1 passes easily from person to person and has infected millions globally since March, killing at least 5,000 people whose infections have been documented.

    <body>Nov 4 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- An Afghan police officer opened fire on British soldiers in the volatile southern province of Helmand, killing five, British and Afghan authorities said Wednesday, raising concerns about discipline within the Afghan forces and possible infiltration by insurgents.

- Bulk shipments of the main component of the H1N1 vaccine made at a Quebec plant are being exported to other countries, as Canadians line up for hours for the scarce influenza shots.

BUSINESS:

- Mountain Equipment Co-op, which has built its retailing reputation on a feel-good image of environmental and social responsibility, has ignited anger in an unlikely place -- the bicycle industry.

Its foray this month into bike selling has been criticized by rival specialty retailers for everything from unfair competition because of its tax-exempt status, to a Wal-Mart-style money grab, to unethical sourcing.

- Warren Buffett&apos;s bold move to snap up Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp (BNI.N), a railway with tracks running through his hometown of Omaha, shines a new light on an industry that he believes is poised to ride an economic rebound.

NATIONAL POST:

- Despite dire talk about vaccine shortages and supply problems, a large portion of the H1N1 vaccine shipped out by the federal government in the last three weeks has yet to be injected in to Canadians arms.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Gold soared to a record high Tuesday after India surprised the market with the biggest single purchase of the commodity by a central bank in the past 30 years -- a signal governments around the world are becoming increasingly uncomfortable about the sliding value of the U.S. dollar.</body>

    <body>* Signs that declines in revenue stabilizing

* CEO says H1N1 flu not hitting bookings

* Working on new code-share pacts

* Earnings down 46 pct

(Recasts with CEO interview, analyst comment)

By Nicole Mordant

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov 4 (Reuters) - WestJet Airlines Ltd (WJA.TO) posted a 46 percent slide in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but Canada&apos;s second-biggest carrier sees signs that a brutal air-travel slowdown is ending.

In the past six to eight weeks, declines in revenue per available seat mile, or RASM, a key industry benchmark, look to have leveled off, the no-frills airline&apos;s chief executive said, sending WestJet&apos;s share price higher.

&quot;I am cautiously optimistic that (the environment) has improved,&quot; said Sean Durfy in an interview. &quot;I think the marketplace is less sensitive to pricing and we are starting to see a pickup.&quot;

Though Durfy said the trend &quot;might be a blip,&quot; analysts jumped on the comments as a positive sign.

&quot;It was certainly the most optimistic outlook for the last few quarters,&quot; said Paradigm Capital analyst Doug Cooper.

&quot;There is reason to believe that RASM will trend higher in 2010, driven by the return of the business traveler, which they are starting to see signs of,&quot; he said.

Durfy said he was pleased with the fares WestJet is getting this winter on flights to sunny destinations like Mexico and the Caribbean. So far he couldn&apos;t link any decline in travel bookings to the H1N1 flu virus.

OTHER CODE-SHARE AGREEMENTS

Earlier, WestJet reported earnings of C$31.4 million ($29.6 million), or 24 Canadian cents a share, for the three months to Sept. 30. That&apos;s down from a profit of C$57.9 million, or 45 Canadian cents, on weak demand and price cuts as airlines scrambled to fill seats.

The results were below the 27 Canadian cents a share analysts on average had expected from Air Canada&apos;s (ACa.TO) biggest domestic competitor, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue at the airline, one of the few profitable carriers in the world, fell 16.4 percent to C$600.6 million and RASM fell 15.5 percent.

WestJet has signed a number of memorandums of understanding with other unnamed airlines to enter into code-share agreements, Durfy said, referring to partnerships that lets one carrier sell tickets to passengers from another carrier.

The Calgary, Alberta-based airline is already working toward a full code-share deal with Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA).

Glitches experienced with the launch last month of its new Sabre reservation system were hopefully behind it and shouldn&apos;t have an impact on fourth quarter results, Durfy said.

WestJet expects its capacity to increase between 2 percent and 3 percent in the fourth quarter, mostly to cross-border and other international destinations. The airline flies to 60 cities in North America and the Caribbean.

The carrier will take delivery of five aircraft in the fourth quarter, boosting its fleet to 86 by year-end.

Separately WestJet said its load factor, the percentage of available seats that are filled with paying passengers, fell 1.7 percentage points to 79.7 percent in October.

The stock rose 11 Canadian cents or 1 percent, to C$11.20 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. ($1=$1.06 Canadian) (Additional reporting by Scott Anderson; editing by Frank McGurty)</body>

    <body>CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Senior health officials in the Canadian province of Alberta said on Wednesday they had fired an unidentified worker for giving National Hockey League players preferential access to the H1N1 flu vaccine.

The controversy boiled over this week when it was revealed that players for the NHL&apos;s Calgary Flames and their families received shots on an exclusive basis one day before the province closed public flu clinics due to a shortage of the vaccine.

&quot;Our policies on vaccine distribution are designed to ensure an equitable distribution of the vaccine to all Albertans,&quot; Alberta Health Services Chief Executive Stephen Duckett said in a statement.

&quot;The special treatment for the Flames and their families is unacceptable to us and contrary to all of our existing protocols and processes. I apologize for this breach of our duty to Albertans.&quot;

Public outrage over the revelations showed that Canadians&apos; love for a hockey team, even when it includes such franchise stars as forward Jarome Iginla and goaltender Mikka Kiprusoff, only goes so far during a pandemic.

The health agency said it was continuing its investigation and more disciplinary action could be taken.

The flap over the Flames topped a chaotic several days for mass vaccination in the province of 3.5 million residents that started with hours-long queues at makeshift clinics and ended with the abrupt halt to H1N1 shots when far more people than expected showed up for them.

The Alberta authority said it would restart shots for higher-risk people such as young children and pregnant women, but it will keep vaccine from the general public for now.

KABUL, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The number of Afghans infected by the deadly H1N1 virus has more than quadrupled in two days, a health ministry official said on Wednesday.

Seven more people have also been killed by the virus since the first death was recorded last week, public health ministry spokesman Farid Raaid said.

To curb the flu&apos;s spread, the government declared a health emergency on Monday and ordered all schools closed for three weeks as part of measures against the virus.

Some 350 positive cases of H1N1 -- 273 of which are among foreigners -- were recorded by Sunday, but the figure doubled to almost 700 by late Tuesday, Raaid said.

The government has launched a massive public awareness programme about taking preventative measures in the war-ravaged country where illiteracy is high and health facilities are basic.

The government has enough vaccine on hand for 50,000 people, but hoped to receive 1 million doses from the World Health Organisation, Raaid said.

    <summary>... without knowing of it. Ukrainian authorities have said at least three people have died of the H1N1 variety of flu. Out of some 450,000 ...</summary>
    <body>KIEV, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Ukrainian leader Viktor Yushchenko on Wednesday accused opponents running against him in a January presidential election of criminal negligence in the way they have handled an outbreak of swine flu. Yushchenko said bitter rival Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, ex-prime minister Viktor Yanukovich and parliamentary speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn were all aware of a flu epidemic in the week they organised mass rallies for their own campaigns.

The government announced a series of strict measures such as school closures and a ban on public events, including rallies, last week after the first confirmed swine flu death.

Yushchenko, unlikely to win re-election with support at 5 percent of the population or under, was due to hold his rally on Saturday -- after the measures were put in place.

&quot;The first and most effective method of prevention is not to allow mass gatherings of people. But, ignoring this rule, hundreds of thousands of people were brought to Kiev for various events from different regions,&quot; Yushchenko told television stations in a broadcast to the nation.

&quot;I want to stress that those who organised these events knew the situation and they&apos;ve ignored it. The parliament speaker and the leader of the opposition and, most importantly, the prime minister, ignored the facts of the epidemics,&quot; Yushchenko said.

&quot;This is completely similar to the May Day rallies in Kiev after the Chernobyl disaster,&quot; he said referring to the Soviet cover-up of the 1986 nuclear reactor explosion to Ukrainians who were exposed to radiation for days without knowing of it.

Ukrainian authorities have said at least three people have died of the H1N1 variety of flu. Out of some 450,000 cases of acute respiratory illness registered in the country about 20 or slightly under have been confirmed as swine flu.

More than 80 people have died since mid-October of the flu and other respiratory illnesses and the World Health Organisation has said it assumes most flu cases in Ukraine have been caused by the H1N1 virus.

Both Tymoshenko and Yushchenko have sought to take a lead in handling the flu epidemic -- while the president appealed for aid from neighbouring countries, the prime minister met the first consignment of medicines at the airport on Sunday.

&quot;I see not only moral, but criminal responsibility here. I have asked Ukraine&apos;s General Prosecutor&apos;s office to start a criminal investigation into the cases of negligence&quot; amongst Ukraine&apos;s top health officials and government members, Yushchenko said.

Opposition leader Yanukovich leads the opinion polls with about 28 percent and is expected to face Tymoshenko, with about 20 percent support now, in a final round of voting in February. (Writing by Sabina Zawadzki)</body>

    <body>LONDON (Reuters) - Swine flu has hit an isolated tribe of Indians in the Amazon jungle, with seven dying in the last two weeks, Survival International said on Wednesday.

A further 1,000 members of the Yanomami tribe in Venezuela are believed to have caught the flu, the indigenous peoples rights group said.

It is feared the flu could sweep through the area and kill many more Yanomami as the Indians have little resistance to introduced diseases.

About 32,000 Yanomami live in the Venezuela-Brazil border region and form the largest relatively isolated tribe in the Amazon.

Survival director Stephen Corry said the situation was critical and the Venezuelan and Brazilian governments must act immediately to halt the epidemic and improve health care for the Yanomami.

&quot;If they do not, we could once more see hundreds of Yanomami dying of treatable diseases. This would be utterly devastating for this isolated tribe, whose population has only just recovered from the epidemics which decimated their population 20 years ago,&quot; he said in a statement.

About 20 per cent of the Yanomami tribe died from flu, malaria and other diseases in the 1980 and 1990s when goldminers invaded their land, Survival said.

The Venezuelan government has closed the border and sent medical teams.

The H1N1 virus -- the correct medical term for swine flu -- has spread globally and killed nearly 5,000 people since appearing early this year, according to the World Health Organization.</body>

    <body>By Jargal Byambasuren and Lucy Hornby

ULAN BATOR, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The price of horse meat has risen in Mongolia, as a surge in H1N1 cases and dearth of vaccines has people turning to folk remedies.

Seven people died and 630 cases have been treated in the two weeks since the H1N1 strain of influenza first appeared in Mongolia, forcing the government to close kindergartens, extend a holiday for secondary schools and cancel sports and cultural events, the English-language UB Post reported on Tuesday.

Across Asia, the onset of winter has coincided with a rapid rise in H1N1 cases, with governments closing schools to try and slow the spread of the disease. Afganistan ordered a three-week closure of all schools from Monday after that country&apos;s first reported H1N1 death [ID:nISL499361].

&quot;We are not surprised that in the Northern Hemisphere we&apos;re seeing an increase in cases, including fatal and serious cases. We&apos;re not surprised, but we are concerned,&quot; said Vivian Tan, spokeswoman for the World Health Organization in Beijing.

&quot;One of our biggest concerns is the developing world, because they are not as equipped to deal with the deteriorating situation.&quot;

In Mongolia, which has yet to receive vaccines for H1N1, non-emergency surgeries were postponed indefinitely to ensure enough hospital beds. The UB Post said a delivery of vaccines slated for November had been delayed to December.

Worried Mongolians spread the rumour that eating horse meat might stave off the disease, pushing up prices.

In South Korea, where the disease has killed 42 people, health authorities raised the epidemic alert to the highest level. Nearly 400 schools have closed voluntarily.

&quot;Infection levels are increasing rapidly. However, ordinary citizens have no reason to be alarmed,&quot; the South Korean health ministry said in a statement, adding it has started a vaccination programme and stockpiled medicine.

A major concern for parents and health officials comes next week when South Korea holds its national college entrance exam that brings tens of thousands of teens together across the country to take a test that many feel can chart the course for the rest of their lives.

In Beijing, H1N1 claimed the life of a 32-year-old Russian man, who had arrived in the city last week and checked into the hospital with breathing difficulties on Nov. 1, the Xinhua news agency said. China has reported nearly 49,000 cases and seven deaths as of Monday.

By Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The White House denied on Tuesday that any H1N1 flu vaccine is now going to terrorism suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, heading off controversy over swine flu prevention priorities.

&quot;There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there&apos;s no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo,&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at his daily briefing, although a Pentagon spokesman said detainees at the base could receive it late this month.

After Gibbs&apos; comment, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said detainees at Guantanamo would receive the vaccine only after active duty troops, deployed U.S. contractors and civilians and civilians working for the Department of Defense.

Americans have been lining up for the vaccine to protect against the H1N1 swine flu virus, which has killed at least 1,000 Americans and infected an estimated 5 million.

Given a shortage of the vaccine, clinics have restricted its distribution to those in high-risk groups, but even many of those have been unable to receive it.

A Department of Defense spokesman had said the vaccine would be offered to about 200 Guantanamo detainees, prompting criticism from some conservative politicians and commentators.

&quot;Gitmo doesn&apos;t have any vaccine and is not expected to receive any vaccine for some time, probably late November at the earliest,&quot; Whitman said.

&quot;Because there are limitations on supplies of H1N1 vaccine, we&apos;ve established priorities... But we do have an obligation to provide appropriate medical care to everyone in our custody.&quot;

Whitman said receiving H1N1 vaccine is voluntary for detainees, in other words, many may opt not to receive the vaccine.

The United States has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Swine flu can cause severe disease in people of all ages and appears to pose a special threat to those who are obese, according to an analysis of H1N1 cases in California released on Tuesday.

Public health researchers analyzed the state&apos;s first 1,088 hospitalized and fatal cases of H1N1 infection between April 23 and August 1.

Like other studies, they found the average patient who was hospitalized with H1N1 flu was younger than what is commonly seen with seasonal flu, but they also found severe disease at both ends of the age spectrum.

&quot;What our study shows was that once you were hospitalized, if you were elderly you have a higher risk of dying,&quot; Dr. Janice Louie of the California Department of Public Health in Richmond, whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the study matches the CDC&apos;s own observations -- that H1N1 affects all age groups, including people over 65.

&quot;If they get it, it can be every bit as severe as seasonal flu, consistent with other data,&quot; Frieden told a news briefing.

&quot;It does emphasize that providers should think of H1N1 influenza in all age groups,&quot; he said.

Frieden said the new findings do not change the CDC&apos;s recommendations for vaccination, which focus on younger people, those with underlying conditions such as asthma and pregnant women.

What it does suggest is that doctors need to be aware of the risks to their older patients if they do become infected, Louie said.

NOT A MILD DISEASE

&quot;One of the perceptions we&apos;ve been trying to dispel is that this is a mild disease,&quot; she said in a telephone interview.

&quot;This can be very severe. In this paper, 30 percent of patients required intensive care.&quot;

Overall, 11 percent of people who were hospitalized died, but among people 50 and older, 18 to 20 percent died.

The most common causes of death were viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

As with other studies, obesity appeared to play a significant role in the severity of disease.

In the 268 cases of adults over 20 whose weight was known, 58 percent were obese, with a body mass index of over 30, and of these, 67 percent were morbidly obese, with a BMI of over 40.

BMI is equal to weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. A person 5 feet 5 inches tall becomes obese at 180 pounds (82 kg).

&quot;There definitely is something that is standing out as far as the obesity issue,&quot; Louie said.

&quot;We certainly don&apos;t see the same thing with seasonal flu.&quot;

Louie said in California, the flu has caused shortages of antiviral drugs and of N95 respirator masks, but so far, based on her contact with doctors in the state, swine flu has not overwhelmed hospitals.

A report by Trust for America&apos;s Health suggested a mild pandemic could send as many as 168,025 people in California to the hospital.

    <body>RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) approved GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus on Tuesday, as the kingdom gears up to receive more than two million pilgrims at next month&apos;s haj.

&quot;The authority ... has been following through all the phases of the production of the A (H1N1) flu vaccine by several international companies specialized in vaccines,&quot; the SFDA said in a statement posted on its website.

The authority added that it decided to register GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s vaccine, which is distributed under the Pandemrix brand name.

Saudi Arabia will begin a national vaccination campaign on Saturday, he said. The kingdom has a population of nearly 25 million, nearly a third of whom are expatriates.

Priority will be given to pilgrims and hospital staff, health ministry spokesman Khaled Mirghalani said.

He could not immediately say whether Saudi Arabia would buy all of its vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline.

&quot;We have ordered 10 million vaccine units from Belgium, Great Britain and the United States. We have already received a first batch,&quot; Mirghalani said.

Around 3 million Muslim pilgrims from more than 160 countries take part in the haj in the holy city of Mecca most years, including up to 2 million who travel from abroad. Haj this year will start in during the last week of this month.

Disease experts from the United States and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, said last week that waves of H1N1 flu virus spread by pilgrims traveling to and from Mecca for next month&apos;s haj threatened to put pressure on healthcare systems around the world.

The pilgrimage provides perfect conditions for the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, which is transmitted by sneezing and physical contact.

&quot;Everything is being done to ensure all goes well,&quot; ministry spokesman Mirghalani said.

The Saudi FDA also moved to allay fears about the potential side effects of the vaccine, saying any impact would be little different from those of seasonal flu vaccines.

The Mirghalani said children will not be inoculated without parental approval.

Disease experts from the United States and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, said last week that waves of H1N1 flu virus spread by pilgrims travelling to and from Mecca for next month&apos;s haj threatened to put pressure on healthcare systems around the world.

The pilgrimage provides perfect conditions for the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, which is transmitted by sneezing and physical contact.

&quot;Everything is being done to ensure all goes well,&quot; ministry spokesman Mirghalani said.

The Saudi FDA also moved to allay fears about the potential side effects of the vaccine, saying any impact would be little different from those of seasonal flu vaccines.

The Mirghalani said children will not be inoculated without parental approval. (Reporting by Souhail Karam; editing by Karen Foster)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Up to 30 million doses of vaccine against the pandemic H1N1 flu have been delivered to the U.S. government and production is now picking up, officials said on Monday.

But they said more studies confirm that children under the age of 9 will need two doses to be fully protected.

And studies in pregnant women, one of the groups most vulnerable to swine flu, show no indication of side effects from the vaccine.

The U.S. government is working to make vaccines and drugs available to fight the pandemic while countering fears about safety and criticisms that officials were too optimistic in predicting how quickly the vaccine would be ready.

Original predictions suggested that at least 80 million doses should have been delivered to state health departments, clinics and retailers by now and a few politicians have complained.

Lines have formed as people seek the vaccine for themselves and their children to protect against the virus, which has killed at least 1,000 Americans and infected an estimated 5 million.

&quot;Over time, we expect that supply will start to increase and eventually catch up with the tremendous demand that we are seeing now,&quot; Dr Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a news briefing.

&quot;As of today, 30 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine are available for the states to order.&quot; That is a cumulative amount -- CDC had 26.6 million doses of vaccine available on Friday.

&quot;We know that about half the vaccine that has been administered so far has been to children under 18,&quot; Schuchat said. Unlike seasonal flu, which is most dangerous to the elderly, H1N1 is hitting younger adults and children especially hard.

Clinical trials being run by the government confirm that children under age 9 need two doses of the swine flu vaccine -- optimally four weeks apart -- to be fully protected.

Last week the World Health Organization said governments might consider giving a single dose to as many children as possible, but Dr Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the scientific data showed it is important to get children vaccinated twice.

WEAKER RESPONSE

&quot;Children 6 months to 9 years had a less robust immune response,&quot; Fauci said. Initially, children were tested a week to 10 days after getting the first dose. Follow-up for three weeks confirms they need a second boost, Fauci said.

Fauci said results from pregnant women also showed the vaccine worked well -- not unexpected because seasonal vaccine also works well -- and caused no serious side effects.

He said 28 pregnant women have died in the United States from swine flu so far.

A special team of non-government experts has been assembled and was holding its first meeting on Monday to look at reports on the vaccine&apos;s safety, said Dr Bruce Gellin of the National Vaccine Program Office at the Health and Human Services Department.

Fauci disputed critics who say the vaccine is being distributed too slowly to be of use against the virus, which is active across the entire country.

&quot;You cannot assume that this is going to disappear,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think you can make the assumption that anything is going to be too little, too late.&quot;

And Schuchat said the CDC was working to make an experimental antiviral drug available to hospitals that might need it for the most seriously ill patients.

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc&apos;s peramivir has been cleared for experimental intravenous use in the sickest patients. Schuchat said the company donated 1,200 courses of the drug but that works out to just 600 treatments in reality.

    <body>By Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House denied on Tuesday that any H1N1 flu vaccine is now going to terrorism suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, heading off controversy over swine flu prevention priorities.

&quot;There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there&apos;s no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo,&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at his daily briefing, although a Pentagon spokesman said detainees at the base could receive it late this month.

After Gibbs&apos; comment, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said detainees at Guantanamo would receive the vaccine only after active duty troops, deployed U.S. contractors and civilians and civilians working for the Department of Defense.

Americans have been lining up for the vaccine to protect against the H1N1 swine flu virus, which has killed at least 1,000 Americans and infected an estimated 5 million.

Given a shortage of the vaccine, clinics have restricted its distribution to those in high-risk groups, but even many of those have been unable to receive it.

A Department of Defense spokesman had said the vaccine would be offered to about 200 Guantanamo detainees, prompting criticism from some conservative politicians and commentators.

&quot;Gitmo doesn&apos;t have any vaccine and is not expected to receive any vaccine for some time, probably late November at the earliest,&quot; Whitman said.

&quot;Because there are limitations on supplies of H1N1 vaccine, we&apos;ve established priorities... But we do have an obligation to provide appropriate medical care to everyone in our custody.&quot;

Whitman said receiving H1N1 vaccine is voluntary for detainees, in other words, many may opt not to receive the vaccine.

The United States has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Australia&apos;s CSL, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.

* CDC says sick workers spread disease

* 31.8 million H1N1 vaccines now administered or available

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. employers who tell workers to stay home when they are sick will have to give them paid time off for up to five days under new federal legislation proposed on Tuesday.

The emergency law would cover pandemic H1N1 flu or any other infectious disease, said California Representative George Miller, a Democrat who chairs the House Education and Labor Committee and who introduced the bill.

&quot;Sick workers advised to stay home by their employers shouldn&apos;t have to choose between their livelihood, and their co-workers&apos; or customers&apos; health,&quot; Miller said.

&quot;This will not only protect employees, but it will save employers money by ensuring that sick employees don&apos;t spread infection to co-workers and customers, and will relieve the financial burden on our health system swamped by those suffering from H1N1.&quot;

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises employers to encourage sick workers to stay home so they do not spread H1N1. &quot;But workers have been reporting that many of them are either afraid or cannot afford to take time off,&quot; Miller told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Paid sick leave is not required by U.S. laws.

Miller said the committee would hold a hearing the week of November 16 and he would press to have a full vote as soon as possible.

Miller said at least 50 million American workers are not paid for time taken off sick, &quot;many in lower-wage jobs that have direct contact with the public such as the food-service and hospitality industry, schools and health care fields.&quot;

MORE VACCINE READY

In a regular briefing, CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said 31.8 million doses of flu vaccine have now become available -- still far short of the minimum of 80 million to 100 million that had been projected for the first week of November.

This number includes vaccine already administered. Frieden said CDC hoped 10 million new doses will have been made available by the end of the week.

He said the pandemic may be having an unexpected side-effect -- increasing demand for the seasonal influenza vaccine. &quot;We think this year will be the highest ever uptake on seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Frieden said.

&quot;We anticipate there being around 114 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine available through the market by the end of the year. It may be there is even greater demand than that by the end of the season.&quot;

This includes healthcare workers, who are often reluctant to be vaccinated. In recent years, only around 38 to 40 percent of healthcare workers get flu vaccines, but that percentage may be higher this year, Frieden said.

As with the vaccine against H1N1 swine flu, distribution is slow and patchy for seasonal flu vaccine. &quot;We continue to hear that people are unable to get the vaccine,&quot; Frieden said.

The United States buys both seasonal and H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), AstraZeneca Plc&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit, Novartis (NOVN.VX), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), and CSL Limited (CSL.AX).

Some members of Congress and media commentators complained that detainees at Guantanamo Bay -- the U.S. base in Cuba -- would receive H1N1 vaccines when Americans were still struggling to find them.

But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs denied this on Tuesday. &quot;There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there&apos;s no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo,&quot; he told reporters.

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Swine flu has driven up the price of horse meat in Mongolia, closed schools across Afghanistan and Ukraine and sparked a quarrel over whether detainees at a U.S. base in Cuba should be vaccinated.

As infections accelerated across the northern half of the world, Saudi authorities approved a vaccine ahead of the annual haj pilgrimage and U.S. members of Congress proposed legislation to force employers to pay or sick leave.

The pandemic H1N1 virus has infected millions globally, with more than 5,000 documented deaths and likely far more.

A study published on Tuesday added to the growing body of knowledge about the virus, confirming that while it rarely infects people over 65, once it does it is as deadly to them as seasonal flu is. [ID:nN03514822]

In Mongolia, the government closed kindergartens, extended a holiday for secondary schools and canceled sports and cultural events, the English-language UB Post newspaper reported. [ID:nPEK164665]

Worried Mongolians spread the rumor that eating horse meat might stave off the disease, pushing up prices.

In South Korea, where 42 deaths have been confirmed, health authorities raised the epidemic alert to the highest level. Nearly 400 schools have closed voluntarily.

The Saudi Food and Drug Authority approved one of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) vaccines for the H1N1 swine flu virus on Tuesday, as the kingdom gears up for more than 2 million visitors at next month&apos;s haj, the annual pilgrimage undertaken by many observant Muslims. [nL3692176 ]

SUBSTANTIAL ACTIVITY

Afghanistan declared a health emergency [nISL499361] and ordered schools closed for three weeks. The government has also advised the public against gatherings such as weddings in enclosed areas.

&quot;There is substantial influenza activity and we would expect to see more. Certainly the indications are that this will become something quite widespread across the northern hemisphere temperate zones as we go forward through the late autumn and winter,&quot; the World Health Organization&apos;s Gregory Hartl said. [nL3584631]

In the United States, a member of Congress proposed emergency legislation that would require employers who tell workers to stay home when they are sick to give them paid time off for up to five days.

Health officials have been urging anyone with flu-like symptoms such as cough and fever to stay home, but up to 50 million Americans risk a day&apos;s pay and perhaps their jobs if they do. [ID:nNB3517091]

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that 11 percent of people who were hospitalized in California died, but among people 50 and older, 18 to 20 percent died. [ID:nN03514822]

The most common causes of death were viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the researchers found, and as with other studies, obesity appeared to play a significant role in the severity of disease.

Americans have been struggling to find H1N1 vaccines, with only 30 million doses available to protect a population 10 times that size.

VACCINATING PRISONERS

The White House denied that any H1N1 flu vaccine is now going to terrorism suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba after members of Congress and some media commentators complained, but a Department of Defense spokesman said the vaccine would be offered to about 200 Guantanamo detainees.

After months of talks, the largest U.S. nurses union and California&apos;s biggest nonprofit healthcare chain agreed to safeguards that the nurses believe may serve as a national model for curbing H1N1 swine flu in hospitals and averting a one-day strike threatened by thousands of registered nurses at more than 30 hospitals. [ID:nN02469514]

Swine flu fears helped fuel strong sales of disinfecting products. Clorox Co (CLX.N) posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast. [nN02431736]

&quot;H1N1, that&apos;s the name of the game,&quot; said UBS analyst Nik Modi. &quot;That&apos;s what really helped them with the upside.&quot;

The U.S. Department of Agriculture found the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in a commercial swine herd in Indiana as federal agencies stepped up their hunt for the virus in pigs. [ID:nN02460409]. It has been found in herds in Canada and Britain as well.

The United States has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

* CDC says sick workers spread disease

* 31.8 million H1N1 vaccines now administered or available

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. employers who tell workers to stay home when they are sick will have to give them paid time off for up to five days under new federal legislation proposed on Tuesday.

The emergency law would cover pandemic H1N1 flu or any other infectious disease, said California Representative George Miller, a Democrat who chairs the House Education and Labor Committee and who introduced the bill.

&quot;Sick workers advised to stay home by their employers shouldn&apos;t have to choose between their livelihood, and their co-workers&apos; or customers&apos; health,&quot; Miller said.

&quot;This will not only protect employees, but it will save employers money by ensuring that sick employees don&apos;t spread infection to co-workers and customers, and will relieve the financial burden on our health system swamped by those suffering from H1N1.&quot;

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises employers to encourage sick workers to stay home so they do not spread H1N1. &quot;But workers have been reporting that many of them are either afraid or cannot afford to take time off,&quot; Miller told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Paid sick leave is not required by U.S. laws.

Miller said the committee would hold a hearing the week of November 16 and he would press to have a full vote as soon as possible.

Miller said at least 50 million American workers are not paid for time taken off sick, &quot;many in lower-wage jobs that have direct contact with the public such as the food-service and hospitality industry, schools and health care fields.&quot;

MORE VACCINE READY

In a regular briefing, CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said 31.8 million doses of flu vaccine have now become available -- still far short of the minimum of 80 million to 100 million that had been projected for the first week of November.

This number includes vaccine already administered. Frieden said CDC hoped 10 million new doses will have been made available by the end of the week.

He said the pandemic may be having an unexpected side-effect -- increasing demand for the seasonal influenza vaccine. &quot;We think this year will be the highest ever uptake on seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Frieden said.

&quot;We anticipate there being around 114 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine available through the market by the end of the year. It may be there is even greater demand than that by the end of the season.&quot;

This includes healthcare workers, who are often reluctant to be vaccinated. In recent years, only around 38 to 40 percent of healthcare workers get flu vaccines, but that percentage may be higher this year, Frieden said.

As with the vaccine against H1N1 swine flu, distribution is slow and patchy for seasonal flu vaccine. &quot;We continue to hear that people are unable to get the vaccine,&quot; Frieden said.

The United States buys both seasonal and H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), AstraZeneca Plc&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit, Novartis (NOVN.VX), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), and CSL Limited (CSL.AX).

Some members of Congress and media commentators complained that detainees at Guantanamo Bay -- the U.S. base in Cuba -- would receive H1N1 vaccines when Americans were still struggling to find them.

But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs denied this on Tuesday. &quot;There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there&apos;s no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo,&quot; he told reporters.

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Swine flu has driven up the price of horse meat in Mongolia, closed schools across Afghanistan and Ukraine and sparked a quarrel over whether detainees at a U.S. base in Cuba should be vaccinated.

As infections accelerated across the northern half of the world, Saudi authorities approved a vaccine ahead of the annual haj pilgrimage and U.S. members of Congress proposed legislation to force employers to pay or sick leave.

The pandemic H1N1 virus has infected millions globally, with more than 5,000 documented deaths and likely far more.

A study published on Tuesday added to the growing body of knowledge about the virus, confirming that while it rarely infects people over 65, once it does it is as deadly to them as seasonal flu is. [ID:nN03514822]

In Mongolia, the government closed kindergartens, extended a holiday for secondary schools and canceled sports and cultural events, the English-language UB Post newspaper reported. [ID:nPEK164665]

Worried Mongolians spread the rumor that eating horse meat might stave off the disease, pushing up prices.

In South Korea, where 42 deaths have been confirmed, health authorities raised the epidemic alert to the highest level. Nearly 400 schools have closed voluntarily.

The Saudi Food and Drug Authority approved one of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) vaccines for the H1N1 swine flu virus on Tuesday, as the kingdom gears up for more than 2 million visitors at next month&apos;s haj, the annual pilgrimage undertaken by many observant Muslims. [nL3692176 ]

SUBSTANTIAL ACTIVITY

Afghanistan declared a health emergency [nISL499361] and ordered schools closed for three weeks. The government has also advised the public against gatherings such as weddings in enclosed areas.

&quot;There is substantial influenza activity and we would expect to see more. Certainly the indications are that this will become something quite widespread across the northern hemisphere temperate zones as we go forward through the late autumn and winter,&quot; the World Health Organization&apos;s Gregory Hartl said. [nL3584631]

In the United States, a member of Congress proposed emergency legislation that would require employers who tell workers to stay home when they are sick to give them paid time off for up to five days.

Health officials have been urging anyone with flu-like symptoms such as cough and fever to stay home, but up to 50 million Americans risk a day&apos;s pay and perhaps their jobs if they do. [ID:nNB3517091]

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that 11 percent of people who were hospitalized in California died, but among people 50 and older, 18 to 20 percent died. [ID:nN03514822]

The most common causes of death were viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the researchers found, and as with other studies, obesity appeared to play a significant role in the severity of disease.

Americans have been struggling to find H1N1 vaccines, with only 30 million doses available to protect a population 10 times that size.

VACCINATING PRISONERS

The White House denied that any H1N1 flu vaccine is now going to terrorism suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba after members of Congress and some media commentators complained, but a Department of Defense spokesman said the vaccine would be offered to about 200 Guantanamo detainees.

After months of talks, the largest U.S. nurses union and California&apos;s biggest nonprofit healthcare chain agreed to safeguards that the nurses believe may serve as a national model for curbing H1N1 swine flu in hospitals and averting a one-day strike threatened by thousands of registered nurses at more than 30 hospitals. [ID:nN02469514]

Swine flu fears helped fuel strong sales of disinfecting products. Clorox Co (CLX.N) posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast. [nN02431736]

&quot;H1N1, that&apos;s the name of the game,&quot; said UBS analyst Nik Modi. &quot;That&apos;s what really helped them with the upside.&quot;

The U.S. Department of Agriculture found the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in a commercial swine herd in Indiana as federal agencies stepped up their hunt for the virus in pigs. [ID:nN02460409]. It has been found in herds in Canada and Britain as well.

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Swine flu can cause severe disease in people of all ages and appears to pose a special threat to those who are obese, according to an analysis of H1N1 cases in California released on Tuesday.

Public health researchers analyzed the state&apos;s first 1,088 hospitalized and fatal cases of H1N1 infection between April 23 and August 1.

Like other studies, they found the average patient who was hospitalized with H1N1 flu was younger than what is commonly seen with seasonal flu, but they also found severe disease at both ends of the age spectrum.

&quot;What our study shows was that once you were hospitalized, if you were elderly you have a higher risk of dying,&quot; Dr. Janice Louie of the California Department of Public Health in Richmond, whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the study matches the CDC&apos;s own observations -- that H1N1 affects all age groups, including people over 65.

&quot;If they get it, it can be every bit as severe as seasonal flu, consistent with other data,&quot; Frieden told a news briefing.

&quot;It does emphasize that providers should think of H1N1 influenza in all age groups,&quot; he said.

Frieden said the new findings do not change the CDC&apos;s recommendations for vaccination, which focus on younger people, those with underlying conditions such as asthma and pregnant women.

What it does suggest is that doctors need to be aware of the risks to their older patients if they do become infected, Louie said.

NOT A MILD DISEASE

&quot;One of the perceptions we&apos;ve been trying to dispel is that this is a mild disease,&quot; she said in a telephone interview.

&quot;This can be very severe. In this paper, 30 percent of patients required intensive care.&quot;

Overall, 11 percent of people who were hospitalized died, but among people 50 and older, 18 to 20 percent died.

The most common causes of death were viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

As with other studies, obesity appeared to play a significant role in the severity of disease.

In the 268 cases of adults over 20 whose weight was known, 58 percent were obese, with a body mass index of over 30, and of these, 67 percent were morbidly obese, with a BMI of over 40.

BMI is equal to weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. A person 5 feet 5 inches tall becomes obese at 180 pounds (82 kg).

&quot;There definitely is something that is standing out as far as the obesity issue,&quot; Louie said.

&quot;We certainly don&apos;t see the same thing with seasonal flu.&quot;

Louie said in California, the flu has caused shortages of antiviral drugs and of N95 respirator masks, but so far, based on her contact with doctors in the state, swine flu has not overwhelmed hospitals.

A report by Trust for America&apos;s Health suggested a mild pandemic could send as many as 168,025 people in California to the hospital.

* Canada ahead of U.S. per capita but pressure builds

OTTAWA, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The Canadian government, facing public impatience over the pace of vaccinations for the H1N1 flu, signaled on Tuesday that it might no longer sole-source vaccines for future pandemics.

&quot;As we move forward, just as we have more than one supplier for seasonal (flu vaccine), we&apos;ll probably be looking at that as an option (for pandemic vaccines) into the future,&quot; Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones told the Toronto Star newspaper. A spokeswoman confirmed the gist of his remarks.

Canada now relies only on GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) for its H1N1 vaccine. Though Canada has received more than three times as many doses, on a per capita basis, than the United States, huge, hours-long line-ups have formed in big cities to get the shots.

GlaxoSmithKline produced 2 million vaccines a week for three weeks but this week is cutting back to about half a million because of the requirement that it produce a special variety for pregnant woman.

The United States now has five vaccine suppliers for both seasonal and H1N1 flu, so that if one has a problem there is an alternative source.

* Canada ahead of U.S. per capita but pressure builds (Adds details)

OTTAWA, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The Canadian government, facing public impatience over the pace of vaccinations for the H1N1 flu, defended its use of a single vaccine supplier on Tuesday but said it would consider use of several sources of vaccine for future pandemics.

&quot;We are doing better than any other country in producing vaccine on a per capita basis, with one company,&quot; said Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq in a news conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.

But Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones added that after the pandemic ends, Canada will consider whether to use more than one supplier in the case of future pandemics &quot;to hedge our bets&quot;.

Canada has vaccinated between 10 and 20 percent of the population in many communities, Butler-Jones said, but he said he does not know how many people have been vaccinated overall.

The federal government has distributed 6 million doses so far to the provinces and territories, Aglukkaq said.

Access to vaccine across the country varies. The sparsely populated northern territory of Nunavut has its entire supply of vaccine for the general population, while the western province of Manitoba has temporarily shut down clinics because of a shortage.

The vaccination of all Canadians who want the vaccine remains on track for completion by Dec. 25, Butler-Jones said.

Canada relies only on GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) for its H1N1 vaccine. Though Canada has received more than three times as many doses, on a per capita basis, than the United States, hours-long lineups have formed in big cities to get the shots as demand has grown faster than vaccine supplies.

GlaxoSmithKline produced 2 million doses a week for three weeks but this week is cutting back to about 700,000 doses because of the requirement that it produce a special variety for pregnant women. Distribution should return to 2 million doses next week and 3 million per week thereafter, Butler-Jones said.

    <body>* Warsaw wants EU to help Ukraine fight swine, seasonal flu

* Poland ups its H1N1 cases to 185, no deaths so far

(Adds Poland&apos;s health minister comments)

WARSAW, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has called on the European Union to help neighbouring Ukraine fight a flu epidemic and a growing number of H1N1 cases, saying its further spread is threatening the wider bloc.

Ukraine shut schools, banned public meetings and restricted travel earlier this month in an attempt to combat the H1N1 flu epidemic, which has also caused public concern in Poland.

&quot;The character of this threat demands that rapid action be undertaken at the European Union level,&quot; Tusk wrote in a letter to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, who holds the rotating EU presidency.

&quot;This will serve both the interests of Ukraine, and the EU itself,&quot; he said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.

Tusk urged Brussels to hold an extraordinary meeting of the EU&apos;s health council to identify Ukraine&apos;s needs and discuss availability of vaccines.

Poland&apos;s Health Minister Ewa Kopacz said there had so far been 185 cases of swine flu and around 41,000 of seasonal flu diagnosed in the biggest ex-communist EU member. There have been no deaths.

&quot;I don&apos;t understand why we are all so worried about a rare flu that has a much more gentle course than the regular one. I don&apos;t understand why people do not take vaccines for seasonal flu,&quot; she told a Polish television channel.

But news broadcasts showed Poles lining up at pharmacies to get sanitary masks which were quickly sold out in a sign of growing public concern.

Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer told Reuters that Warsaw was awaiting a reply from Brussels, and said he feared the epidemic could spread rapidly in eastern Europe.

&quot;Poland has already organised quite reasonable help for Ukraine, but in a split second we will see swine flu in Belarus, we are already hearing something about Romania,&quot; he said.

Shipments of medicine and medical equipment have been leaving Poland for Ukraine in recent days. A growing number of swine flu cases have also been reported in Germany and Slovakia, which likewise share borders with Poland. (Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; editing by David Stamp)</body>

By Stephanie Nebehay

GENEVA, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Pregnant women and other people at high risk should be vaccinated against the H1N1 swine flu virus as the cold weather begins to bite in the northern hemisphere, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday.

It voiced concern that some vulnerable people are shying away from the pandemic vaccine, which the WHO stressed had not caused any unusual side effects in hundreds of thousands of people to have received it worldwide so far.

&quot;Certainly the fact that the vaccine isn&apos;t being used by those who would have access to it and who would be in priority risk groups is of concern, yes,&quot; WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told a news briefing.

At least 5,712 people have died from the swine flu virus, according to the United Nations agency. Health workers, pregnant women and people with conditions such as asthma are deemed at greatest risk and should be top priority for getting the shot.

&quot;We have seen many, many instances of people in high risk groups such as pregnant women who have very severe disease or outcomes. These outcomes could be in all likelihood avoided if one were to get vaccinated,&quot; Hartl said.

A flu epidemic in Ukraine -- with more than 250,000 cases and 70 deaths from acute respiratory illness reported so far by national authorities on Tuesday -- may be an &quot;early warning signal&quot; as winter sets in, the WHO said.

&quot;The outbreak in Ukraine may be indicative of how the virus can behave in the northern hemisphere during the winter season, particularly in health care settings typically found in Eastern Europe,&quot; the WHO said in a statement.

The former Soviet republic closed schools, banned public meetings and restricted travel last Friday for three weeks.

HITTING THE YOUNG

Unlike seasonal flu, which is most dangerous to the elderly, H1N1 is hitting younger adults and children especially hard.

The WHO recommends a single vaccine dose for protecting adults against H1N1. It has also urged governments to consider giving a single dose to as many children under age 10 as possible, but says more research is needed into child dosages.

In the United States, studies show that children under the age of 9 will need two doses of the vaccine to be fully protected, officials there said on Monday [ID:nN02462530].

Parts of North America and Europe have already crossed the epidemic threshold, ahead of the normal influenza season which peaks in January-February for the northern hemisphere, WHO says.

&quot;There is substantial influenza activity and we would expect to see more. Certainly the indications are that this will become something quite widespread across the northern hemisphere temperate zones as we go forward through the late autumn and winter,&quot; Hartl said.

But the WHO is reluctant to speak of a &quot;second wave&quot; of outbreaks, as the virus may have just been less active in the summer months, he said. Colder weather favours its spread.

Countries from China to the United States have rolled out vaccination campaigns and the rare side effects have been mild, in line with those caused by seasonal flu vaccines, Hartl said.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) are among some 25 drugmakers companies producing pandemic vaccine. (For WHO Ukraine statement, go to r.reuters.com/hut47f ) (Editing by Jonathan Lynn)</body>

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - After months of talks, the largest U.S. nurses union and California&apos;s biggest nonprofit healthcare chain have agreed to safeguards that the nurses believe may serve as a national model for curbing H1N1 swine flu in hospitals.

The H1N1 pact, announced on Monday as part of a contract settlement between the California Nurses Association and Catholic Healthcare West, averted a one-day strike threatened by thousands of registered nurses at more than 30 hospitals.

Already one of the most powerful political forces in California, the CNA is working to merge soon with the United American Nurses and the Massachusetts Nurses Association, a move that would create a combined union of 150,000 nurses.

The accord addresses complaints by nurses in California and elsewhere that many hospitals are ill-prepared for a surge in H1N1 cases. Among other problems, they cite shortages of special face masks recommended for medical personnel and a lack of patient-isolation rooms to contain flu transmission.

Nurses&apos; advocates say cost-saving measures have led some hospitals to cut corners on purchasing safety equipment and some to fall behind in training and planning. Some nurses have accused hospital administrators of improperly rationing face masks to conserve limited supplies.

Worries about equipping nurses with gear to protect them from infection -- and from spreading the H1N1 virus -- has been heightened by problems getting swine flu vaccine delivered in time to inoculate healthcare workers before the pandemic intensified in recent weeks.

The centerpiece of the new settlement is the establishment of an emergency task force pairing nurses with hospital administrators to oversee readiness throughout the Catholic Healthcare West system whenever a pandemic is declared.

Special nurses committees will be formed at each hospital in the network to work with infection-control teams in carrying out system-wide policies and procedures.

A VOICE AT THE TABLE

&quot;This model gives front-line care givers a voice at the highest levels of decision-making within a corporate healthcare system,&quot; said Jill Furillo, the union&apos;s chief negotiator.

Union chief Rose Ann DeMoro called it &quot;an innovative model that every hospital in America should follow.&quot;

Catholic Healthcare West, which runs more than 40 hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada, was more restrained in its comments, as was the American Hospital Association. Neither embraced the notion that the California nurses&apos; pact would set a precedent for others to follow.

&quot;We have been focused on H1N1 for quite some time and welcome their additional collaboration with us,&quot; Catholic Healthcare spokeswoman Jill Dryer said. &quot;Where that takes us in the future, or for others, has yet to be determined.&quot;

Alicia Mitchell of the American Hospital Association said the industry would continue to look to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for guidance.

The California Nurses Association, representing 86,000 registered nurses in all 50 U.S. states, has said compliance with CDC guidelines on H1N1 is uneven.

A survey of 190 hospitals by the group&apos;s nurses in August found more than one in five lacked sufficient numbers of the disposable N95 respirator masks recommended by the CDC.

Where mask supplies were adequate, the survey found many nurses were instructed to reuse them, instead of disposing of them after each patient contact, as CDC guidelines urge.

Nurses at more than a quarter of the hospitals surveyed reported patients were not properly isolated, and fewer than half the nurses said they received adequate H1N1 training.

The labor pact, if ratified, will cover 13,000 registered nurses at 28 hospitals in California and four more in Nevada.

Furillo said a key factor in reaching the settlement was California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s decision last month to order the release of 25 million respirator masks, half the state&apos;s stockpile, to ease shortages.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The pandemic H1N1 influenza virus has been found for the first time in a commercial swine herd, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Monday.

The sick herd was found in Indiana, the USDA said, noting both the pigs and their caretakers have fully recovered from the virus, commonly called swine flu. USDA said the Indiana facility has continued its routine processing practices because it is safe for swine that recover from influenza viruses to be slaughtered.

A USDA spokesman said it could not release the city, name of the facility or the size of the herd where the pandemic H1N1 virus was found &quot;in order to ensure continued high levels of participation in swine surveillance efforts, and because this is not a food safety or public health risk.&quot;

The human form of the new H1N1 virus, which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June, is circulating the globe. Researchers at The Centers for Disease Control estimated last week that as many as 5.7 million people in the United States have been infected so far, with at least 1,300 deaths.

Last week, USDA said six pigs shown at the Minnesota State Fair in September had been confirmed as having had the pandemic H1N1 flu virus. The USDA found the virus in the first U.S. hog on October 19 -- one of the six positives from the fair.

&quot;It&apos;s expected that pigs will get this particular flu strain just like pigs every year get the flu,&quot; said Dave Warner of the National Pork Producers Council, who added he would not be surprised to see more cases of pandemic H1N1 in U.S. hogs.

&quot;It&apos;s just not an issue. It&apos;s not unexpected,&quot; he said.

World health officials have stressed the flu cannot be contracted from eating pork.

But the virus has affected pork trade, most notably to China, which has banned U.S. pork since May because of the outbreak in humans. Chinese officials said last Thursday they plan to lift the ban.

The USDA&apos;s finding appeared to have little impact on hog markets on Monday as analysts had forecast for some time that humans could transmit the flu to hogs.

Hog futures were higher in afternoon electronic trading following USDA&apos;s announcement before drifting back to near unchanged from the pit close. Also, shares of Smithfield Foods Inc, the largest U.S. hog and pork producer, were up on the New York Stock Exchange.

Hog futures have sped higher recently as investment funds have poured money into the market.

&quot;This may stall the rally for a moment, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s over,&quot; Rich Nelson, analyst at Allendale Inc, said of Monday&apos;s news.

Jim Clarkson, livestock analyst with A&amp;A Trading Inc, added that he doesn&apos;t expect any market reaction until all the facts become available regarding the size of the herd and what is being done to keep it in check.

&quot;I don&apos;t know that anybody is going to react to something like that until it&apos;s confirmed and you know what kind of size it (hog operation) is,&quot; said Clarkson.

The new strain of H1N1 virus, which has genetics from swine, birds and humans, likely circulated undetected in pigs for at least a decade before jumping to humans, according to an expert at the University of Arizona.

Swine flu, common in hogs around the world, causes fever and coughing in pigs, which usually recover from the illness. The virus has been found in several herds in Canada.

USDA said it would post all future suspected and confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza detections on a spreadsheet at www.usda.gov/H1N1flu.

    <body>BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is experiencing a new wave of the H1N1 flu virus, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Monday.

Latest figures show the number of new infections recorded rising to about 3,000 a week, said Joerg Hacker, head of the institute, compared to about 1,860 previously.

&quot;The wave we expected for the autumn has started,&quot; Hacker told reporters. &quot;We are on an upward curve.&quot;

So far, six people in Germany have died of H1N1 and 30,000 have been ill with it.

&quot;In the future, you cannot rule out serious illnesses and an increase in the number of deaths,&quot; he said, adding most of the victims were now being infected in Germany whereas in the summer, people had caught the virus on trips abroad.

Germany recorded its first known death from the pandemic version of the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, on October 8, and has just begun a public vaccination program.

Similar programs are also under way in the United States, Britain, Canada and China.

CHICAGO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. lean hog futures rose 1.8 percent to a 3-1/2 month high on Monday amid a wave of buying by funds that extended across a range of commodities.

News that the pandemic H1N1 flu was found in a commercial swine herd in Indiana had no impact on futures.

The U.S. Agriculture Department said in a statement after pit trading had closed -- but when Globex trading was in progress -- that the pigs as well as caretakers had fully recovered from the flu, the first detected in a U.S. commercial herd.

&quot;It&apos;s a nonevent,&quot; said Jim Clarkson, livestock analyst with A&amp;A Trading Inc.

Funds accounted for much of the rally in futures during the day and the trend appeared to be holding in post-settlement electronic trade despite the H1N1 news.

&quot;It&apos;s strong technically. Funds still get involved the first (trading day) of the month with new money coming into the market,&quot; said James Burns, independent hog trader. &quot;There was also a lack of bad news. Everything is just kind of firm.&quot;

Traders cited talk that cash hogs would likely trade steady much of the week on good packer interest and they also cited a continued firm tone to the cash ham market. Commodities in general were also rallying today with a lower dollar seen helping to boost exports.

December lean hogs 2LHZ9 closed up 1.025 cents at 57.725 cents per lb and February 2LHG0 was up 1.000 at 64.600 cents. December posted a 3-1/2 month high and February moved above the 200-day moving average to set a four-month high.

Live cattle futures also rallied late, but their run-up was attributed to cash cattle unexpectedly trading on a Monday.

Cash cattle traded steady at $88 per cwt in Texas and that sparked short-covering demand that lifted futures from early mixed trade. Although steady cash trade had been expected this week as cash cattle were seen topping, cattle trading on a Monday instead of later in the week surprised the market.

Last week, cash cattle traded higher at $87 to $88 per cwt in the southern Plains, and at $86 to $87 on a live basis and $135 on a dressed basis in Nebraska.

December live cattle 2LCZ9 ended up 0.550 cent at 86.225 cents per lb and February 2LCG0 was up 0.750 at 87.600.

A lower U.S. dollar and higher beef prices on Monday also provided support after early pressure from concern over the large amount of deliveries against October before it expired on Friday limit down.

USDA on Monday put the choice wholesale boxed beef price up 80 cents at $141.63 per cwt. [BEEF/BOX].

Feeder cattle futures also moved higher along with other commodities, especially with some support being encouraged by the ability of traders to buy feeder futures and hedge them at a profit in deferred live cattle futures.

November feeder cattle 2FCX9 closed up 0.325 at 95.125 cents per lb and January 2FCF0 was up 0.500 at 95.575. (Reporting by Jerry Bieszk)</body>

KABUL, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Afghanistan declared a health emergency on Monday to help the government prevent the rapid spread of H1N1, and ordered schools closed for three weeks as part of measures against the deadly virus.

The government has also advised the public against gatherings such as weddings in enclosed areas, after Afghanistan had its first death attributed to the virus last week.

Nearly 350 positive cases of H1N1 have been detected among foreigners and Afghans and several hundred more people are suspected to be infected, a public health ministry spokesman said.

The positive cases, 271 reported among expatriates and the rest among Afghans, reflect a dramatic rise in infections registered in recent months, Farid Raaid told Reuters.

&quot;We have declared a health emergency state on the basis of which all private (and) governmental educational institutions as well as kindergartens have been ordered to close for three weeks.&quot;

An evaluation will be made after two weeks to determine whether to reopen those institutions, he said.

The announcement of the health emergency comes amid uncertainty as to whether the country will hold a run-off presidential election on Nov. 7 and if so how authorities planned to prevent the spread of the virus that day.

The government has waged a massive public awareness campaign in the country, battered by decades of war and where illiteracy is high.

The U.N. World Health Organisation has pledged to provide one million doses of vaccine to Afghans to tackle the disease, Raaid said.

Researches have shown that without applying preventative measures approximately 22 percent of the population will be infected by the disease, the public health ministry said in a statement.

One out of 80 cases of the influenza will die, it said.

&quot;Therefore, if we assume population of Afghanistan between 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 a total 5.5-6.6 million population will be at risk of contracting ... and around 70,000 people will die of consequences of the disease,&quot; it added.

KABUL, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Afghanistan declared a health emergency on Monday to help the government prevent the rapid spread of H1N1, and ordered schools closed for three weeks as part of measures against the deadly virus.

The government has also advised the public against gatherings such as weddings in enclosed areas, after Afghanistan had its first death attributed to the virus last week.

Nearly 350 positive cases of H1N1 have been detected among foreigners and Afghans and several hundred more people are suspected to be infected, a public health ministry spokesman said.

The positive cases, 271 reported among expatriates and the rest among Afghans, reflect a dramatic rise in infections registered in recent months, Farid Raaid told Reuters.

&quot;We have declared a health emergency state on the basis of which all private (and) governmental educational institutions as well as kindergartens have been ordered to close for three weeks.&quot;

An evaluation will be made after two weeks to determine whether to reopen those institutions, he said.

The announcement of the health emergency comes amid uncertainty as to whether the country will hold a run-off presidential election on Nov. 7 and if so how authorities planned to prevent the spread of the virus that day.

The government has waged a massive public awareness campaign in the country, battered by decades of war and where illiteracy is high.

The U.N. World Health Organisation has pledged to provide one million doses of vaccine to Afghans to tackle the disease, Raaid said.

Researches have shown that without applying preventative measures approximately 22 percent of the population will be infected by the disease, the public health ministry said in a statement.

One out of 80 cases of the influenza will die, it said.

&quot;Therefore, if we assume population of Afghanistan between 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 a total 5.5-6.6 million population will be at risk of contracting ... and around 70,000 people will die of consequences of the disease,&quot; it added.

* Pregnant women tolerate H1N1 vaccine well (Adds statement from politicians, investigation)

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Up to 30 million doses of vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu virus have been delivered to the U.S. government and production is now picking up, officials said on Monday.

But more studies confirm that children under the age of 9 will need two doses of the vaccine to be fully protected, they said.

Studies in pregnant women, one of the groups most vulnerable to the pandemic, also show no indication of side effects from the vaccine.

The U.S. government is trying to make vaccines and drugs available to fight the virus while countering fears about safety and criticisms that officials were too optimistic in predicting how quickly the vaccine would be ready.

Original predictions suggested at least 80 million doses should have been delivered to state health departments, clinics and retailers by now and a few politicians have complained.

People have been lining up for the vaccine to protect against the virus, which has killed at least 1,000 Americans and infected an estimated 5 million.

&quot;Over time, we expect that supply will start to increase and eventually catch up with the tremendous demand that we are seeing now,&quot; Dr Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a news briefing.

&quot;As of today, 30 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine are available for the states to order.&quot; That is the cumulative amount -- the CDC had 26.6 million doses of vaccine available on Friday.

Some conservative politicians, including Missouri Representative Roy Blunt, who helps lead Republican healthcare reform efforts, have questioned the Department of Defense decision to offer vaccine to about 200 detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba.

&quot;It&apos;s outrageous that in Missouri, expectant mothers, children and others vulnerable to the H1N1 virus do not have access to the vaccine, and our tax dollars are funding vaccines for accused terrorists detained at Gitmo,&quot; said Blunt.

VACCINATING CHILDREN

Unlike seasonal flu, which is most dangerous to the elderly, H1N1 is hitting younger adults and children especially hard. &quot;We know that about half the vaccine that has been administered so far has been to children under 18,&quot; Schuchat said.

Clinical trials being run by the government confirm that children under age 9 need two doses of the swine flu vaccine -- optimally four weeks apart.

Last week, the World Health Organization said governments might consider giving a single dose to as many children as possible. But Dr Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the scientific data showed it is important that children under 9 are vaccinated twice because they have a weaker immune response than adults.

A team of non-government experts has been assembled and was holding its first meeting on Monday to look at reports on the vaccine&apos;s safety, said Dr Bruce Gellin of the National Vaccine Program Office at the Health and Human Services Department.

Fauci disputed criticism that the vaccine is being distributed too slowly to be of use against the virus, which is now active across the entire country.

&quot;You cannot assume that this is going to disappear,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think you can make the assumption that anything is going to be too little, too late.&quot;

The United States buys both seasonal and H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), AstraZeneca Plc&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit, Novartis (NOVN.VX), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), and CSL Limited (CSL.AX).

Separately, Connecticut&apos;s top prosecutor said he is investigating complaints of price fixing by companies that make and distribute the seasonal flu vaccine. (Editing by Eric Beech and Chris Wilson)</body>

    <body>By Lucas Mearian - Computerworld

Though the H1N1 flu has been declared a national emergency by President Barack Obama, experts say that many companies remain ill-prepared for its potential consequences, which could include employee absentee rates of 40% or more.

While last month&apos;s emergency declaration is targeted mostly at helping health care providers and government agencies bypass regulatory requirements to provide critical care, experts say it should also be a red flag for the IT and business communities.

&quot;Organizations probably have not allocated enough resources for virtual private networks nor tested VPNs for the fact that 80% of their staff could be working from home,&quot; said Al Berman, executive director of DRI International, a training institute that focuses on helping businesses prepare for emergencies. &quot;We ran some tests with companies, and they ran out of TCP/IP addresses in five minutes.&quot;

Berman said that many businesses are probably delaying VPN upgrades because of increasing bandwidth costs. For example, he said, DRI recently met with officials of a large insurance provider and found that it would cost the company $1 million to boost bandwidth enough to support 40% of its staff working from home.

The federal government&apos;s Flu.gov Web site, managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, offers guidance to businesses about what to do in the event of a pandemic. Its suggestions range from making sure sick employees stay home to appointing a pandemic coordinator or team to oversee the preparation and implementation of a disaster plan.

Employers should &quot;send a very strong message to employees to stay home if they&apos;re sick. No one is that essential,&quot; said Kim Elliott, deputy director of Trust for America&apos;s Health, a public health advocacy group. &quot;You don&apos;t want employees coming in and infecting others to the point where your business shuts down.&quot;

The pandemic coordinator or team should monitor employees to ensure that they follow basic rules of hygiene, such as washing their hands, and make sure that face masks are available, according to the Flu.gov Web site.

Elliott said that the planning process should also include an assessment of how the absence of a large number of employees would affect operations, with recommendations on how to keep things running under such circumstances.

&quot;That may mean cross-training employees in some key business functions,&quot; Elliott said, citing IT infrastructure maintenance, bookkeeping and accounting duties, and some customer-facing activities.

Businesses should also develop a plan to communicate with municipal agencies, which determine whether bus routes, schools or even businesses need to be shut down, Berman said.

The national emergency declaration came after a weekly U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report called FluView noted that 43 states are now reporting widespread influenza activity and that H1N1 has caused 1,000 deaths in the U.S.

The World Health Organization had declared the H1N1 flu outbreak a pandemic in June , elevating its health emergency alert status to Phase 6 -- its highest level. At that time, the number of influenza cases was close to 30,000 worldwide. The WHO now says there are 414,000 confirmed cases of H1N1 and that there have been nearly 5,000 H1N1-related deaths.

WEAKER RESPONSE

&quot;Children 6 months to 9 years had a less robust immune response,&quot; Fauci said. Initially, children were tested a week to 10 days after getting the first dose. Follow-up for three weeks confirms they need a second boost, Fauci said.

Fauci said results from pregnant women also showed the vaccine worked well -- not unexpected because seasonal vaccine also works well -- and caused no serious side effects.

He said 28 pregnant women have died in the United States from swine flu so far.

A special team of non-government experts has been assembled and was holding its first meeting on Monday to look at reports on the vaccine&apos;s safety, said Dr Bruce Gellin of the National Vaccine Program Office at the Health and Human Services Department.

&quot;You cannot assume that this is going to disappear,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think you can make the assumption that anything is going to be too little, too late.&quot;

And Schuchat said the CDC was working to make an experimental antiviral drug available to hospitals that might need it for the most seriously ill patients.

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc&apos;s (BCRX.O) peramivir has been cleared for experimental intravenous use in the sickest patients. Schuchat said the company donated 1,200 courses of the drug but that works out to just 600 treatments in reality.

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Health insurer Humana Inc (HUM.N) forecast a drop in profit next year due in part to pressure on margins as it sees lower U.S. government reimbursement for its Medicare plans for the elderly.

Humana, which also posted a 65 percent jump in third-quarter profit on Monday, is one of the largest providers of Medicare plans so investors have been concerned about a hit to earnings as the government squeezes rates.

Humana shares fell 1.7 percent. Its 2010 forecast was largely in line with Wall Street expectations, when excluding asset writedowns related to the end of a military contract, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Thomas Carroll.

&quot;They put it at a level in line with current expectations,&quot; Carroll said. &quot;They talk about decent enrollment and revenue growth but also feeling some margin pain.&quot;

Humana, whose report comes as Congress debates health reform legislation, excluded from its forecast any potential impact from the health overhaul, such as an industry tax.

The insurer expects a big jump in Medicare Advantage enrollment -- adding as many as 240,000 members -- countered by a decline of about 140,000 members in commercial plans serving employers as the weak economy leads to fewer workers with coverage.

Humana expects an operating Medicare profit margin of about 5 percent next year, down from about 6.5 percent this year.

&quot;They really managed to mitigate the margin hit a lot,&quot; said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ana Gupte. &quot;And they&apos;re really dramatically increasingly Medicare enrollment.&quot;

Third-quarter net income was $301.5 million, or $1.78 per share, compared with $183 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier, when the company was hit by investment losses.

Analysts on average expected $1.77 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 8 percent to $7.72 billion. Analysts expected $7.82 billion.

Humana is the first large health insurer to provide detailed 2010 forecasts, although it follows larger rival UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) in expecting lower earnings per share next year.

WellPoint (WLP.N) and Aetna (AET.N) deferred giving a 2010 forecast until gaining more clarity on factors such as the state of the economy, the severity of the flu season and the outcome of health reform legislation.

Investor concern that reform will dramatically hurt future profits has pressured health insurer shares to rock-bottom valuations. Humana shares have underperformed rivals this year and trade at among the lowest price-to-earnings ratios as Wall Street worries over the future of the private sector in administering Medicare.

Humana&apos;s earnings report drew disdain on Capitol Hill several weeks after the insurer set off a political firestorm over letters sent to its Medicare customers about proposed health reform legislation.

&quot;It&apos;s no wonder why Humana has been misleading seniors about health insurance reform -- they saw their profits rise 65 percent last quarter and want to make sure the gravy train doesn&apos;t end,&quot; said Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Quarterly pretax income at Humana&apos;s government segment, which includes its Medicare business, soared 75 percent to $474.5 million. Membership in its Medicare Advantage plans stood at 1.51 million on Sept. 30, up 11 percent from a year earlier.

Humana posted a pretax loss of $5.2 million for its commercial segment including health plans serving employers, as Americans losing their jobs also lost health coverage. Higher costs from the H1N1 flu also hurt results.

The company forecast 2009 earnings of about $6.15 per share, in line with its prior projected range of $6.10 to $6.20 per share. Analysts expect $6.14.

For 2010, Humana expects earnings of $5.05 to $5.25 per share. Analysts were looking for $5.36.

Humana&apos;s forecast included asset writedowns and charges tied to its exit of the military Tricare contract -- which amounts to about 25 cents per share, Stifel&apos;s Carroll said. Excluding the charge, Carroll said Humana&apos;s forecast equated to a range of $5.30 to $5.50 per share.

Humana shares fell 65 cents to $36.93 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Friday, Humana shares had risen about 1 percent this year, underperforming a 5 percent rise for the S&amp;P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO.

    <summary>... The pandemic H1N1 swine flu virus originated in pigs and evidence suggests it can be passed from humans to pigs and back again. ...</summary>
    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An international team of researchers said Monday it had mapped the DNA of a domestic pig, work they say could help lead to better breeding techniques as well as improve vaccines against diseases such as swine flu.

They plan to look for genes useful in pork production and immunity in pigs, which are similar in size to humans. And, like humans, they catch influenza very easily.

&quot;Understanding the swine genome will lead to health advancements in the swine population and accelerate the development of vaccinations for pigs,&quot; said Roger Beachy, Director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture&apos;s National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

&quot;This new insight into the genetic makeup of the swine population can help reduce disease and enable medical advancements in both pigs and humans,&quot; Beachy said in a statement.

&quot;The pig is a unique animal that is important for food and that is used as an animal model for human disease,&quot; added Larry Schook of the University of Illinois in Champaign, who helped direct the project.

&quot;And because the native wild animals are still in existence, it is a really exciting animal to look at to learn about the genomic effects of domestication.&quot;

The pandemic H1N1 swine flu virus originated in pigs and evidence suggests it can be passed from humans to pigs and back again. Pigs are also susceptible to many other strains of influenza.

    <body>(Corrects RIC in 5th paragraph)

BOSTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Connecticut is investigating complaints of price fixing and preferential treatment in the distribution of seasonal flu vaccine, the state&apos;s Attorney General said on Monday.

Attorney General Richard Blumenthal&apos;s office said it has written to 13 manufacturers and distributors of seasonal flu vaccine, requesting details on price, supply levels and distribution methods by Nov. 15.

Seasonal flu vaccine is in short supply, in part, because distribution has swung to the H1N1 swine flu vaccine.

Blumenthal said his office has received complaints of seasonal flu vaccine being offered at many times the normal price, and of distributors and manufacturers reneging on previously negotiated price agreements.

The vaccine makers contacted by Blumenthal&apos;s office about alleged price gouging were GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK.L); MedImmune Vaccines Inc, a united of Astrazeneca (AZN.N); Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi-Aventis Group (SNY.N); and CSL Biotherapies, part of CSL Limited (CSL.AX).

Nine distributors in five states were also contacted.

drop of more than 2 percent in early trade, as auto and
health-related shares gained. The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI was down 1.72 percent,
or 374.70 points, at 21,378.17 at midday. Turnover was HK$36.66
billion ($4.7 billion), versus midday Friday&apos;s HK$42.60 billion. &quot;There is no significant indication that the global economy
will recover strongly, so investors in Hong Kong are taking
profit,&quot; said Steven Lam, vice-president at Karl-Thomson

outlook weighed on exporters. Chinese property developer Yuzhou Property (1628.HK) was down
4.8 percent on its trading debut. The China Enterprise Index of top locally listed mainland
Chinese stocks was down 1.46 percent at 12,582.58. Bucking the trend, Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), which operates
popular online games in China, rose 2.26 percent on a rosy
earnings outlook. Credit Suisse raised its target price to
HK$153.60 from HK$131.60 and kept its &quot;outperform&quot; rating. &quot;Tencent is gaining share in both the e-commerce and payment
markets,&quot; Credit Suisse said in a note on Monday, adding that its
gaming and advertising revenue would continue to grow. Nine Dragons (2689.HK) was up 1.06 percent. The packaging and
paper maker&apos;s plan to use proceeds from the sale of new shares to
pay off debt would help lift profit, analysts said. China Power International (2380.HK) fell 1.83 percent. The
company said Beijing had approved its plan to build a coal-fired
generation unit in Sichuan province. Chinese ingot and wafer maker Comtec Solar (0712.HK), which
debuted in Hong Kong on Friday, extended its fall, down 8.08
percent at the midday break. The stock closed 5.7 percent lower

fell 2.98 percent to 50.40 yuan. The broader market initially took its cues from New York
stocks, which on Friday posted their biggest one-day fall since
July, but traders quickly shifted attention to the recovering
domestic economy.

released in the morning, rose to an 18-month high of 55.4 from
55.0 in September, underscoring the strength of the manufacturing
sector. [ID:nSEO80466] The official PMI, released on Sunday, rose to an 18-month
high of 55.2 in October from 54.3. [ID:nPEK81136] &quot;The market opened lower with pressure from weakness
overseas, but drew support from the positive PMI and firmer
earnings,&quot; said Zhou Lin, senior analyst at Huatai Securities in
Nanjing. Auto shares rose, cheered by upbeat results. Chongqing
Changan Auto (000625.SZ) gained 5.36 percent to 13.75 yuan after
reporting a 145 percent rise in net profit.

    <summary>... WASHINGTON, Oct 31 - Five drug companies are now increasing production of the vaccine for the H1N1 swine flu, and 10 million more doses are expected next week ...</summary>
    <body>* Larger volumes of vaccine being produced in U.S.

* White House frustrated with slow pace of production

* Obama adviser sees &quot;ample supply in very short order&quot;

WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Five drug companies are now increasing production of the vaccine for the H1N1 swine flu, and 10 million more doses are expected next week, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Saturday.

President Barack Obama on Friday expressed frustration about the slow pace of production of the vaccine, which has resulted in just 26.6 million doses as of Friday, far below earlier estimates of 40 million by the end of October.

Sebelius said those initial estimates were based on &quot;overly optimistic&quot; predictions by the five contracted vaccine makers for the U.S. market -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

But production was now increasing and vaccine doses were being shipped seven days a week, Sebelius told CNN.

&quot;The good news is that we have, as of yesterday, 26.6 million doses out and around the country. We are expecting another 10 million doses next week,&quot; Sebelius said. &quot;So the vaccine is beginning to roll in larger volumes. And it&apos;s being distributed as quickly as it comes off the line.&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s being shipped overnight. We&apos;re getting it from producers seven days a week,&quot; she added.

HHS initially estimated that 20 million doses would roll out every week, but the companies are currently producing only about 10 million doses a week.

The latest count shows 114 children have been killed by the virus in the United States since April, during a time when there is usually virtually no influenza, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

CDC researchers estimated this week that as many as 5.7 million people in the United States have been infected so far, with at least 1,300 deaths. The flu has been reporting in 48 states, an unprecedented level.

David Axelrod, Obama&apos;s senior adviser, told National Public Radio in an interview aired on Saturday that the administration &quot;overpromised&quot; the vaccine based on the companies&apos; assurances.

But he said the problem was abating every day: &quot;We believe that that is improving on a daily basis, and we&apos;re going to have an ample supply in very short order.&quot;

Sebelius told CNN there was now a good mix of the nasal vaccine and the nasal mist available after earlier shortages, and the government expected to make sufficient vaccine doses available &quot;over the next several months.&quot;

The United States still planned to participate in an 11-nation program to donate H1N1 vaccine to developing countries, but only after the priority population in the United States had been vaccinated, Sebelius said.

&quot;The first priority is to get the vaccine to the American people,&quot; Sebelius said. &quot;That&apos;s always been the plan. It continues to be the plan.&quot;

But she said vaccinations were also critical in developing countries and refugee camps, where hundreds of thousands of people could die as a result of the flu, Sebelius said. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa, editing by Anthony Boadle)</body>

    <body>BEIJING, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Saturday warned the country faced an &quot;extremely grim&quot; job to prevent the spread of the H1N1 flu strain, calling on more people to be vaccinated and for vaccine production to be raised.

&quot;At present, the flu prevention situation is extremely grim and there may well be outbreaks or it may spread in certain areas,&quot; Wen told officials during a visit to a Beijing children&apos;s hospital, in comments carried on state television.

People must be &quot;encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible&quot; and &quot;research into and production of vaccines must be stepped up&quot;, he added.

Television pictures showed Wen, a mask tied over his face, talking to children, parents and workers at the hospital.

Health Minister Chen Zhu warned in September that China faced a serious situation in containing the disease as schools start up again and the number of cases rises. [ID:nPEK102128].

China has to date reported 44,981 H1N1 infections, including six deaths, the latest of which was reported on Saturday in the northeastern province of Heilonjiang.

State news agency Xinhua added that a cold snap bearing down on northern China could heighten the flu risk.

But Wen also struck a note of optimism. &quot;We have complete confidence, and the ability to carry out prevention work well and to prevent outbreaks. We must work as hard as possible to reduce the number of serious cases and deaths,&quot; he said.

There are already strict checks at border crossings and many places where crowds gather like karaoke parlours, and the government began a mass vaccination programme in late September, starting with around 100,000 students in Beijing.

Health Minister Zhu said at the time that the government aimed to produce 26 million doses of vaccine by the end of October, and 65 million doses by the end of 2009.

    <body>* Science community angered by adviser&apos;s sacking

* Ministers warned not to play politics with science

* Scientists say policies should be based on evidence

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The British government&apos;s sacking of its chief drugs adviser highlights the tense relationship between scientists who see evidence as objective data and politicians who want use it to woo voters.

Britain&apos;s scientific community reacted with dismay to interior minister Alan Johnson&apos;s decision to push David Nutt out of his job as head of the independent drugs advisory body, saying it undermined the integrity of science in policy.

Scientists said the decision to sack Nutt, who criticised Prime Minister Gordon Brown&apos;s government for ignoring scientific advice on cannabis and ecstasy, could devalue policy-making in areas including health, environment, education and defence.

Climate change, healthcare and tackling the H1N1 swine flu pandemic are all high on the political agenda as Brown -- whose Labour party trails way behind opposition Conservatives -- prepares for an election due by June next year

Nutt said Brown&apos;s was the first government in the history of Britain&apos;s 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act -- the main law covering illegal drugs and categorising them into risk groups -- to have gone against the advice of its scientific panel.

Analysts say playing politics with science may prove to be dangerous.

&quot;Scientific data and their independent interpretation underpin evidence-based policy making -- and nobody rational could possibly want a government based on any other type of policy making,&quot; said Chris Higgins, chair of an advisory committee on spongiform encephalopathy, or &quot;mad cow&quot; disease.

The Labour government downgraded cannabis&apos; legal status on the advisory body&apos;s advice in 2004 but Brown reversed that decision last year saying he wanted to send a strong message that use of the drug was unacceptable.

Nutt publicly criticised this decision, and was told by ministers on Friday to quit his job.

&quot;Some aspects of science...should not be subject to petty party politics,&quot; he told BBC radio on Saturday. &quot;There&apos;s no point in having drug laws that are meaningless or arbitrary just because politicians find it useful and expedient occasionally to come down so-called hard on drugs.&quot;

What angers scientists most is what they see as cherry-picking of evidence by politicians who use data when it suits them and ignore it when it doesn&apos;t.

Nutt said that of the hundreds of recommendations made by his committee, the government has chosen to ignore just two. He accused ministers of misleading the public about the dangers of drugs like cannabis and ecstasy for purely political reasons.

Maurice Elphick, a professor of animal physiology and neuroscience at Queen Mary, University of London, said politicians should look elsewhere if they wanted data to back social policies and allow science to maintain objectivity.

&quot;If, however, politicians really do want to have an objective assessment of the relative risks to health of different recreational drugs, then they should listen to what the medical scientist has to say, not sack him.&quot; he said.

    <body>* WHO sending donated H1N1 vaccines to developing countries

* Initially targets 2 pct of people in 16 countries

* Eventually aims to protect 10 pct of people in 95 states

GENEVA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation has launched a programme to give H1N1 flu vaccines to nearly 100 developing countries, with the first ones receiving the shots soon, its vaccine expert said on Friday.

Marie-Paule Kieny, head of vaccine research at the U.N. health body, said a group of 16 countries was being contacted and should shortly receive enough vaccines to inoculate up to 2 percent of the population.

The countries were recommended to vaccinate health care workers first, she told a news conference.

Eventually the WHO would supply 95 developing countries with a view to immunising over 10 percent of their population against pandemic H1N1, widely known as swine flu.

WHO has received donations of 156 million doses of vaccine from four manufacturers or governments, and hoped to reach the 200 million dose level needed to help 95 countries, she said.

Donor governments are also helping with syringes, needles, other equipment and finance.

The WHO declared H1N1 an unstoppable pandemic in June and it has since spread around the world, with 25 manufacturers making vaccines to different formulations.

WHO experts say the vaccines, of which one shot suffices, are safe.

Teenagers and young adults are most likely to catch swine flu, in contrast to the seasonal flu viruses where the elderly are most at risk.

Most people escape with mild symptoms, but some groups such as pregnant women or people with previous health conditions such as diabetes can suffer severe illness or die from the virus. (Reporting by Jonathan Lynn)</body>

ZURICH, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Switzerland has approved two vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) against H1N1 swine flu, regulators said on Friday, paving the way for a national immunisation campaign.

Switzerland has ordered 13 million doses of vaccine from Novartis and Glaxo, but will only start immunisations once the products are approved by Swissmedic.

Swissmedic approved Glaxo&apos;s Pandemrix, but not for pregnant women, children under the age of 18 and adults over 60. Those over 60 can be inoculated with Pandemrix under recommendations from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH).

Novartis&apos;s Focetria is recommended for use in adults and children over six months old. In the case of pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, the attending doctor must weigh up the inoculation, in accordance with latest vaccine recommendations from the FOPH.

Swissmedic is still testing another Novartis vaccine, Celtura.

Drugmakers say they are on track to deliver as much H1N1 swine flu vaccine to the United States as they promised, in spite of concerns over production. [ID:nLT326192]

Analysts say Glaxo could book around 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) of this business in the fourth quarter as immunisation campaigns get underway. Novartis has said it expects a fourth-quarter sales boost of up to $700 million from its H1N1 pandemic vaccine. ($1=.6041 Pound) (Reporting by Sam Cage; editing by Simon Jessop)</body>

* Yushchenko says Ukraine may call for international help

By Richard Balmforth

KIEV, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Ukraine closed schools and banned public meetings including election rallies and restricted travel on Friday for a three-week period after confirming its first death from H1N1 flu.

Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko announced the measures, saying the virus had reached epidemic levels in three parts of western Ukraine, where there has been an outbreak of respiratory illness since mid-October.

The epidemic coincides with the start of campaigning for a presidential election on Jan. 17. Tymoshenko, herself a front-runner, said the emergency would affect campaign rallies.

&quot;All our pre-election events have been cancelled. They will not be held until the situation has stabilised,&quot; she said in a televised statement.

President Viktor Yushchenko, a bitter rival of Tymoshenko&apos;s, himself called off a public meeting in Kiev where he had been due to roll out his election programme.

He told journalists that 11 people had died of H1N1, also called swine flu, contradicting a Health Ministry report of only one death. An aide and a ministry official said Yushchenko may have made a mistake.

The government allotted 500 million hryvnias ($63 million) for medical supplies to fight the virus, agencies said.

Yushchenko said Ukraine, already suffering the effects of a severe economic downturn, would turn to international institutions and foreign partners for help if the situation developed beyond Ukraine&apos;s capacity to handle it.

SCHOOL HOLIDAY

&quot;All educational institutions without exception ... will be put on a three-week holiday period,&quot; Tymoshenko said. She indicated this could be extended if necessary.

&quot;Apart from this, we will cancel all mass meetings ... for three weeks,&quot; she told an emergency government session. &quot;We will introduce a special system to stop unnecessary travel from one region to another.&quot;

She said Ukraine was in touch with international football authorities to discuss whether the measures would have any effect on two international fixtures scheduled for November.

Ukraine is scheduled to host a UEFA Champions&apos; League soccer clash between Dynamo Kiev and Inter Milan on Nov. 4 and a World Cup qualifying play-off between Ukraine and Greece on Nov. 18.

&quot;We are considering (imposing) a quarantine not only in the west but also across the country, because the virus is spreading very fast,&quot; Health Minister Vasyl Knyazevych told reporters.

In Lviv, the main town in one of the affected regions and normally bustling on a Friday, there were significantly fewer people on the streets. Those who were wore handkerchiefs and scarves across the lower part of their faces.

&quot;There is nothing in the pharmacies. What can I say? There is no medicine at all?&quot; said one woman, Maria Shalyazhinska, queuing outside a pharmacy.

&quot;How come nobody knew this epidemic was coming? Children are sick. The elderly are sick. There are no masks. People are queuing and waiting for supplies to come but nobody knows if they will come or not.&quot;</body>

    <body>KIEV, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Ukraine confirmed its first death from H1N1 swine flu on Friday and officials said that a quarantine could be introduced to halt the spread of the virus.

An outbreak of flu and pneumonia has killed 30 people in western Ukraine since mid-October, but officials have until now insisted this was not the H1N1 strain.

&quot;So far, not all the dead were tested (for H1N1),&quot; a health ministry spokeswoman said. &quot;However, tests on one dead (person) proved positive.&quot;

&quot;We are considering a quarantine not only in the west, but also across the country because the virus is spreading very fast,&quot; Health Minister Vasyl Knyazevych told a news conference, without giving details.

(Adds WHO expert quotes, details, background)

By Jonathan Lynn

GENEVA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Only one dose of vaccine is needed for protection against pandemic H1N1 flu and the jabs have so far proved to be safe, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

Health experts have been debating whether one or two shots are necessary to protect against H1N1, known as swine flu. The number of doses required is key to estimating how many vaccines are needed in total.

The WHO has repeatedly sought to reassure people around the world that the H1N1 vaccines being made by 25 different companies, with various formulations, are safe. [ID:nN16123963]

&quot;All the reports received to date following vaccination -- either in clinical trials or in mass vaccination campaigns -- have shown that the safety profile of these pandemic vaccines is good and is very similar to the one which is known for seasonal influenza vaccine,&quot; said WHO expert Marie-Paule Kieny.

&quot;Nothing special in terms of adverse events has been noted,&quot; Kieny, who heads the U.N. health agency&apos;s vaccine research, told journalists on a telephone conference.

SAFE, SINGLE DOSE

Earlier this week, its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) examined vaccines for H1N1, which tends to affect teenagers and young adults most.

A statement from the Geneva-based WHO said the SAGE experts had found no signs of unusual &quot;adverse events&quot; -- the technical terms for severe complications such as illness or death -- from pandemic vaccines.

As a result, they said pregnant women, who are particularly vulnerable to H1N1, should be given the pandemic vaccines.

At least 5,712 people have died from confirmed cases of H1N1, WHO said in an update.

The SAGE committee recommended that a single dose of H1N1 vaccine should be used for adults and adolescents from age 10.

It said more studies were needed on the effectiveness of vaccines in children aged up to 10 years. Where national health authorities have made children a priority for vaccination, they should aim to vaccinate as many children as possible with a single dose, the group concluded.

The recommendation corresponds to WHO&apos;s estimate earlier this month that one dose suffices. [ID:nLC285783] Last week Europe&apos;s drug watchdog said two doses would be preferable. [ID:nLN358946]

In its statement, the WHO said 1 to 10 percent of patients who developed a serious illness needed hospital treatment. Of those, 10 to 25 percent needed treatment in an intensive care unit and 2 to 9 percent died.

Very young children are most likely to require hospital treatment for the flu strain.

The WHO declared H1N1 an unstoppable global pandemic in June. Kieny said it could still make sense for countries to close schools, as Ukraine has done after its first confirmed swine flu death, to slow the spread of the virus. [ID:nLU288212]

In most cases, the WHO said is safe to administer vaccines for H1N1 and regular seasonal flu together, but not when both were &quot;live attenuated&quot; vaccines such as nasal sprays.

WHO guidance on H1N1 vaccination is seen as pivotal for the pharmaceutical industry&apos;s investment decisions as well as government policies on purchasing and distributing vaccines.

Earlier this week GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) said it would get a boost from H1N1 vaccine sales this year. [ID:nLR454208]

And Sanofi-Aventis [SASY.PA] raised its outlook for 2009 saying the swine flu vaccine could add about $500 million to its sales in the fourth quarter. [ID:nSP443666] (For full WHO statement go to link.reuters.com/buw76f ) (Additional reporting by Laura MacInnis) (Editing by Erik Kirschbaum)</body>

President Viktor Yushchenko, a bitter rival of Tymoshenko&apos;s, himself called off a public meeting in Kiev where he had been due to roll out his election programme.

He told journalists that 11 people had died of H1N1, also called swine flu, contradicting a Health Ministry report of only one death. An aide and a ministry official said Yushchenko may have made a mistake.

The government allotted 500 million hryvnias ($63 million) for medical supplies to fight the virus, agencies said.

Yushchenko said Ukraine, already suffering the effects of a severe economic downturn, would turn to international institutions and foreign partners for help if the situation developed beyond Ukraine&apos;s capacity to handle it.

SCHOOL HOLIDAY

&quot;All educational institutions without exception ... will be put on a three-week holiday period,&quot; Tymoshenko said. She indicated this could be extended if necessary.

&quot;Apart from this, we will cancel all mass meetings ... for three weeks,&quot; she told an emergency government session. &quot;We will introduce a special system to stop unnecessary travel from one region to another.&quot;

She said Ukraine was in touch with international football authorities to discuss whether the measures would have any effect on two international fixtures scheduled for November.

Ukraine is scheduled to host a UEFA Champions&apos; League soccer clash between Dynamo Kiev and Inter Milan on Nov. 4 and a World Cup qualifying play-off between Ukraine and Greece on Nov. 18.

&quot;We are considering (imposing) a quarantine not only in the west but also across the country, because the virus is spreading very fast,&quot; Health Minister Vasyl Knyazevych told reporters.

In Lviv, the main town in one of the affected regions and normally bustling on a Friday, there were significantly fewer people on the streets. Those who were wore handkerchiefs and scarves across the lower part of their faces.

&quot;There is nothing in the pharmacies. What can I say? There is no medicine at all?&quot; said one woman, Maria Shalyazhinska, queuing outside a pharmacy.

&quot;How come nobody knew this epidemic was coming? Children are sick. The elderly are sick. There are no masks. People are queuing and waiting for supplies to come but nobody knows if they will come or not.&quot;</body>

KIEV, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Ukraine closed schools and banned public meetings including election rallies and restricted travel on Friday for a three-week period after confirming its first death from H1N1 flu.

Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko announced the measures, saying the virus had reached epidemic levels in three parts of western Ukraine, where there has been an outbreak of respiratory illness since mid-October.

The epidemic coincides with the start of campaigning for a presidential election on Jan. 17. Tymoshenko, herself a front-runner, said the emergency would affect campaign rallies.

    <body>KIEV, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Ukraine confirmed its first death from H1N1 swine flu on Friday and officials said that a quarantine could be introduced to halt the spread of the virus.

An outbreak of flu and pneumonia has killed 30 people in western Ukraine since mid-October, but officials have until now insisted this was not the H1N1 strain.

&quot;So far, not all the dead were tested (for H1N1),&quot; a health ministry spokeswoman said. &quot;However, tests on one dead (person) proved positive.&quot;

&quot;We are considering a quarantine not only in the west, but also across the country because the virus is spreading very fast,&quot; Health Minister Vasyl Knyazevych told a news conference, without giving details.

By Jonathan Lynn

GENEVA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Only one dose of vaccine is needed for protection against pandemic H1N1 flu and the jabs have so far proved to be safe, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

Health experts have been debating whether one or two shots are necessary to protect against H1N1, known as swine flu. The number of doses required is key to estimating how many vaccines are needed in total.

The WHO has repeatedly sought to reassure people around the world that the H1N1 vaccines being made by 25 different companies, with various formulations, are safe. [ID:nN16123963]

&quot;All the reports received to date following vaccination -- either in clinical trials or in mass vaccination campaigns -- have shown that the safety profile of these pandemic vaccines is good and is very similar to the one which is known for seasonal influenza vaccine,&quot; said WHO expert Marie-Paule Kieny.

&quot;Nothing special in terms of adverse events has been noted,&quot; Kieny, who heads the U.N. health agency&apos;s vaccine research, told journalists on a telephone conference.

SAFE, SINGLE DOSE

Earlier this week, its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) examined vaccines for H1N1, which tends to affect teenagers and young adults most.

A statement from the Geneva-based WHO said the SAGE experts had found no signs of unusual &quot;adverse events&quot; -- the technical terms for severe complications such as illness or death -- from pandemic vaccines.

As a result, they said pregnant women, who are particularly vulnerable to H1N1, should be given the pandemic vaccines.

At least 5,712 people have died from confirmed cases of H1N1, WHO said in an update.

The SAGE committee recommended that a single dose of H1N1 vaccine should be used for adults and adolescents from age 10.

It said more studies were needed on the effectiveness of vaccines in children aged up to 10 years. Where national health authorities have made children a priority for vaccination, they should aim to vaccinate as many children as possible with a single dose, the group concluded.

The recommendation corresponds to WHO&apos;s estimate earlier this month that one dose suffices. [ID:nLC285783] Last week Europe&apos;s drug watchdog said two doses would be preferable. [ID:nLN358946]

In its statement, the WHO said 1 to 10 percent of patients who developed a serious illness needed hospital treatment. Of those, 10 to 25 percent needed treatment in an intensive care unit and 2 to 9 percent died.

Very young children are most likely to require hospital treatment for the flu strain.

The WHO declared H1N1 an unstoppable global pandemic in June. Kieny said it could still make sense for countries to close schools, as Ukraine has done after its first confirmed swine flu death, to slow the spread of the virus. [ID:nLU288212]

In most cases, the WHO said is safe to administer vaccines for H1N1 and regular seasonal flu together, but not when both were &quot;live attenuated&quot; vaccines such as nasal sprays.

WHO guidance on H1N1 vaccination is seen as pivotal for the pharmaceutical industry&apos;s investment decisions as well as government policies on purchasing and distributing vaccines.

Earlier this week GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) said it would get a boost from H1N1 vaccine sales this year. [ID:nLR454208]

And Sanofi-Aventis [SASY.PA] raised its outlook for 2009 saying the swine flu vaccine could add about $500 million to its sales in the fourth quarter. [ID:nSP443666] (For full WHO statement go to link.reuters.com/buw76f ) (Additional reporting by Laura MacInnis) (Editing by Erik Kirschbaum)</body>

GENEVA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Only one dose of vaccine is needed for protection against pandemic H1N1 flu and the jabs have so far proved to be safe, the World Health Organisation said on Friday, citing immunisation experts.

Health experts have been debating whether one or two shots are necessary to protect against H1N1, known as swine flu. The number of doses required is key to estimating how many vaccines are needed in total.

The U.N. health agency has repeatedly sought to reassure people around the world that the H1N1 vaccines being made by 25 different companies -- with various formulations -- are all safe. [ID:nN16123963]

Earlier this week, its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) examined vaccines for H1N1, which tends to affect teenagers and young adults most.

&quot;The experts reviewed early results from the monitoring of people who have received pandemic vaccines and found no indication of unusual adverse reactions,&quot; the Geneva-based WHO said in a statement.

&quot;Some adverse events following vaccination have been notified, but these are well within the range of those seen with seasonal vaccines, which have an excellent safety profile.&quot;

The experts said health officials should continue to monitor H1N1 vaccine programmes for adverse events -- the technical term for severe complications such as illness or death.

The SAGE committee recommended that a single dose of H1N1 vaccine should be used for adults and adolescents from age 10.

It said more studies were needed on the effectiveness of vaccines in children aged up to 10 years. Where national health authorities have made children a priority for vaccination, they should aim to vaccinate as many children as possible with a single dose, the group concluded.

A statement from the Geneva-based WHO said the SAGE experts had found no signs of unusual &quot;adverse events&quot; -- the technical terms for severe complications such as illness or death -- from pandemic vaccines.

As a result, they said pregnant women, who are particularly vulnerable to H1N1, should be given the pandemic vaccines.

At least 5,712 people have died from confirmed cases of H1N1, WHO said in an update.

The SAGE committee recommended that a single dose of H1N1 vaccine should be used for adults and adolescents from age 10.

It said more studies were needed on the effectiveness of vaccines in children aged up to 10 years. Where national health authorities have made children a priority for vaccination, they should aim to vaccinate as many children as possible with a single dose, the group concluded.

The recommendation corresponds to WHO&apos;s estimate earlier this month that one dose suffices. [ID:nLC285783] Last week Europe&apos;s drug watchdog said two doses would be preferable. [ID:nLN358946]

In its statement, the WHO said 1 to 10 percent of patients who developed a serious illness needed hospital treatment. Of those, 10 to 25 percent needed treatment in an intensive care unit and 2 to 9 percent died.

Very young children are most likely to require hospital treatment for the flu strain.

The WHO declared H1N1 an unstoppable global pandemic in June. Kieny said it could still make sense for countries to close schools, as Ukraine has done after its first confirmed swine flu death, to slow the spread of the virus.

In most cases, the WHO said is safe to administer vaccines for H1N1 and regular seasonal flu together, but not when both were &quot;live attenuated&quot; vaccines such as nasal sprays.

WHO guidance on H1N1 vaccination is seen as pivotal for the pharmaceutical industry&apos;s investment decisions as well as government policies on purchasing and distributing vaccines.

Earlier this week GlaxoSmithKline said it would get a boost from H1N1 vaccine sales this year.

And Sanofi-Aventis raised its outlook for 2009 saying the swine flu vaccine could add about $500 million to its sales in the fourth quarter.

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Only half of the people in the United States who most need immediate treatment for H1N1 swine flu are actually seeking it, even as the virus spreads at unprecedented speed, U.S. health officials said on Friday.

The latest count shows 114 children have been killed by the virus in the United States since April, during a time when there is usually virtually no influenza, said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden.

And while President Barack Obama expressed frustration over vaccine delays, analysts said his credibility was at risk if vaccination did not start to go more smoothly.

Frieden said H1N1 is widespread, and case counts continue to rise in most states.

&quot;One of the things that we have been surprised to see is even among people who have underlying conditions such as asthma, heart disease or lung disease, only half sought care,&quot; Frieden told reporters in a briefing.

At the same time, emergency departments were crowded but often with people who did not need medical care, he said.

CDC researchers estimated this week that as many as 5.7 million people in the United States have been infected so far, with at least 1,300 deaths.

Frieden said the CDC had a cumulative 26.6 million doses of vaccine available -- far short of the 40 to 80 million that had been forecast for the end of October. Lines have formed outside clinics as people seek the vaccine.

The Health and Human Services Department had predicted 20 million doses would roll out every week but just 10 million have been produced in the past seven days.

CREDIBILITY GAP

&quot;Frustration over swine flu vaccine availability has created a growing credibility gap for governments in the U.S., Canada, western Europe, Hong Kong and Japan attempting to vaccinate large portions of their population,&quot; Scott Rosenstein of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a note.

&quot;To date, the political fallout from this situation has been relatively minor,&quot; he added.

&quot;Going forward, the failure to deliver on previous vaccine availability projections will make managing the swine flu message and communicating the threat an increasingly difficult challenge for President Obama and leaders in other countries that are rolling out large vaccination programs ... in the coming weeks.&quot;

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has said she relied on estimates from the five contracted vaccine makers for the U.S. market -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

&quot;I think we certainly had hoped that their predictions on this would be correct,&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. [ID:nN30125745]

&quot;The president has been and is frustrated with ensuring that this vaccine is delivered on time and won&apos;t be satisfied until those that want to be vaccinated from H1N1 have the opportunity through the vaccine to do so.&quot;

Frieden said the situation was slowly improving.

&quot;We are seeing more schools doing vaccine clinics. We are seeing more healthcare workers being vaccinated but it is still not nearly as available as we would like,&quot; he said.

School-based vaccine clinics were hard work, he said.

&quot;It&apos;s hard to get the consent forms back,&quot; Frieden said. &quot;It is hard to arrange the logistics.&quot;

But he said all the work would pay off.

&quot;In future years as we try to increase seasonal flu vaccination, that&apos;s the kind of infrastructure and experience that&apos;s being established, that is an investment and will help us to address seasonal flu,&quot; he said. (Editing by John O&apos;Callaghan and Todd Eastham)</body>

We all love our PCs and gadgets, don&apos;t we? Technology publications like this one (and columnists like me) love to wax eloquent about the wonders of the iPhone, the joys of Twitter and the un-Vista like qualities of Windows 7.

Sure, technology is all fun and games -- until somebody gets hurt.

In the spirit of Halloween, I&apos;d like to freak you out with some newly reported threats that could come back to haunt all of us.

1. H1N1 flu pandemic could crash the Internet

The U.S. Government Accountability Office issued a report this week that said fear of the H1N1 flu pandemic could drive up telecommuting. This massive shift in where people are working could make it difficult for ISPs to manage the traffic, causing localized bottlenecks.

Although the report sounds alarmist, the effect of H1N1 fears on the Internet may be understated. The reason is that in the event of a real pandemic, both business travel and school attendance would plummet, in both cases replaced by heavy video-chat or videoconferencing.

The ISP and other infrastructure providers will have to scramble to cope with the shifting usage patterns, but may themselves be working from home -- further exacerbating the problem.

2. Podcasting can kill you.

In the latest round of iPhone, iPod and iTunes updates, Apple completely changed the system for continuous play of podcasts. Before, you would simply create a playlist in iTunes, drag your podcasts into it, then sync. On the device, you would play via the playlist, rather than the podcast area.

Now, when you try to drag podcasts into a playlist, iTunes won&apos;t let you. There&apos;s a new way to do this, but it&apos;s completely non-intuitive and hardly anyone knows how to do it, according to my informal poll.

As a result, podcast fans are manually backing out of a podcast episode they&apos;ve finished listening to, and manually finding, drilling down to and playing the next podcast. In a car, this can kill. Fumbling for podcasts is at least as distracting as texting. Obviously, continuous play of podcasts is something that should just be there, and made super easy if for no other reason than safety.

(The solution, by the way, is to create a Smart Playlist where the criteria is &quot;media kind&quot; and &quot;is&quot; and &quot;podcast&quot; and then make sure that Smart Playlist is synchronizing under the Music tab of your device.)

3. Your cell phone might break your hip.

You&apos;ve heard the neverending controversy about whether cell phones cause cancer, right? University researchers are more likely to say it does, while handset-industry funded research says it doesn&apos;t. While they were off bickering about cancer, a new study came out this week suggesting that wearing a cell phone on your hip may over time weaken the bone density of your pelvic area.

Researchers in Turkey compared bone density on one side of the hip compared with the other in hard-core cell phone belt-carriers, and found that the side they carried their cell phone on had slightly lower bone density.

4. Video games could destroy high school &apos;jock culture&apos;

Call it &quot;triumph of the nerds.&quot; High school is seen by many as one giant, endless contest between &quot;jocks&quot; -- outgoing, athletic, popular kids who excel in sports and cheerleading -- and &quot;nerds&quot; brainier kids who are more introspective, get better grades and enjoy comics, technology, and fandom more than sports.

If one commentator is to be believed, according to comments in forums, &quot;nerds&quot; are finally winning. Videogames are apparently transforming the kind of competitive, aggressive kids who would normally excel at football and other sports into soft, flabby indoor types who play fake games on gaming consoles instead of real games in stadiums, fields and courts. The jocks are becoming nerds.

5. Your cell phone will end all privacy

A piece on NewScientist.com suggests that ordinary cell phones are shaping up to be the Mother of All Privacy Violators.

First, the article points out, much of the private data, financial data, SMS messages and other personal information you think you&apos;ve deleted from your phone may still reside on your phone&apos;s SIM card. If you lose the phone, someone with even moderate skills could read the deleted data using well-known forensic techniques and software.

Second, your average smart phone is loaded with sensors. GPS, accelerometers, even Wi-Fi electronics all can be used to find out where you are. This information is stored somewhere and could be used to track your every move.

Third, cell phones can be used for phishing. In the same way that thieves build non-functioning ATM machines to scan your ATM card and record your password, fake cell phones could do the same thing, grabbing your cell phone number, account passwords and other personal data.

And finally, sports-performance apps combined with Google Maps could be a new threat. Any enterprising cell phone thief could plug your athletic GPS data into Google Maps and see where you&apos;ve been. By using the Street View feature, stalkers could actually see a photo of your house, complete with address on the mailbox.

This Halloween season seems to have more terrifying threats than usual. Technology has become so scary that I&apos;ll be dressing as &quot;Balloon Boy&quot; this Halloween: Yeah, I&apos;ll be hiding in a box in the garage.

WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Only half of the people in the United States who most need immediate treatment for H1N1 swine flu are actually seeking it, even as the virus spreads at unprecedented speed, U.S. health officials said on Friday.

The latest count shows 114 children have been killed by the virus in the United States since April, during a time when there is usually virtually no influenza, said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden.

H1N1 is widespread, he said, and case counts continue to rise in most states.

&quot;One of the things that we have been surprised to see is even among people who have underlying conditions such as asthma, heart disease or lung disease, only half sought care,&quot; Frieden told reporters in a briefing.

At the same time, emergency departments were crowded but often with people who did not need medical care, he said.

CDC researchers estimated this week that as many as 5.7 million people in the United States have been infected so far, with at least 1,300 deaths.

The pandemic influenza is mild to moderate in most people but it can cause sudden, severe and overwhelming disease in certain groups, such as those with chronic disease.

Unlike seasonal influenza, which is dangerous mostly to the elderly, this new strain is hitting younger adults and children -- including at least a third with no previous health condition.

&quot;People with underlying conditions who have fever or cough should see their provider promptly,&quot; Frieden said.

Frieden said the CDC had a cumulative 26.6 million doses of vaccine available -- far short of the 40 million that had been forecast for October. Lines have formed outside clinics as people seek the vaccine.

VACCINE FRUSTRATION

The CDC has designated about 160 million people as having priority, including pregnant women, children, healthcare workers and people under age 65 with underlying diseases.

Even President Barack Obama expressed frustration at the slow pace of vaccine production.

The Health and Human Services Department had predicted 20 million doses would roll out every week but just 10 million have been produced in the past seven days.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has said she relied on estimates from the five contracted vaccine makers for the U.S. market -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

&quot;I think we certainly had hoped that their predictions on this would be correct,&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. [ID:nN30125745]

&quot;The president has been and is frustrated with ensuring that this vaccine is delivered on time and won&apos;t be satisfied until those that want to be vaccinated from H1N1 have the opportunity through the vaccine to do so.&quot;

The world got another smartphone this week with Motorola&apos;s Droid, available from Verizon. Google rolled out Android 2.0 as well. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers finally voted to allow non-Latin characters in domain names, and Windows 7 news continued apace, among other things. So read on and Happy Halloween everyone (see number 10).

1. Motorola Droid review, Motorola Droid vs. Apple iPhone 3GS: finally, a contender?, Droid: Motorola&apos;s savior or Google&apos;s false profit? and Android 2.0: The iPhone killer at last: We&apos;re topping the list with a range of IDG&apos;s coverage of the Motorola Droid this week because we know that our readers just cannot get enough smartphone news, especially if that news gives rise to speculation that the iPhone now has serious competition (nevermind that in the U.S. at least our favored BlackBerry still, if barely, rules the market).

2. Google releases Android 2.0 SDK, spills on features, Android 2.0: Your complete primer and Google Maps Navigation: Free and easy: Google released its &quot;substantial&quot; Android 2.0 update, including a cool new maps application (that is available in Motorola&apos;s Droid handset).

3. ICANN to allow non-Latin characters in domain names: ICANN finally got with the &quot;worldwide&quot; part of the Web and agreed to allow non-Latin languages in domain names

4. Microsoft_confirms_Windows_7_install_trick_is_legal&quot;&gt;Microsoft confirms Windows 7 install trick is legal, Microsoft trumpets Windows 7 support options, response speed, Unfinished Windows 7 feature turns laptops into Wi-Fi hotspots, Windows 7: Choosing the right version, 32-bit Windows 7 or 64-bit Windows 7? and Windows 7 security: 5 things you should know: We knew there would be a lot of residual news related to last week&apos;s Windows 7 launch, though our crystal ball was a bit dim on just what that news would be. Now we know and so here it is, along with some handy tips on how to decide which version of the new Microsoft OS to obtain, including some thoughts on 32-bit versus 64-bit, and security considerations.

5. Oracle sheds new light on future of Sun technologies: Oracle continues to, albeit slowly, offer details on its plans for Sun Microsystems technologies that it will acquire when (if?) the European Commission gives its nod to the deal.

6. Gartner_joins_GAO_in_raising_flu_network_congestion_fears&quot;&gt;Gartner joins GAO in raising flu network congestion fears, 4 swine flu scams making the rounds and Harvard Medical School develops swine flu iPhone app: If the swine-flu pandemic leads to a lot of employees telecommuting when they feel well enough to work but not quite well enough to commute network problems could ensue, analyst firm Gartner said, echoing a U.S. Government Accountability Office report that said federal agencies are not prepared in that event. In other IT news related to the novel H1N1 virus, Harvard Medical School has developed an iPhone app that disseminates information about the flu and scammers are taking advantage of the pandemic to try to lure people into schemes.

7. Facebook_Virus&quot;&gt;Password reset e-mail is new Facebook virus, Twitter users tricked by new phising attack and New spam: Your bank has failed, download this Trojan: We thought we&apos;d lump the these security stories together because they all fall under the heading of things that companies will not do or that you, as an Internet user, should not do. Facebook will not contact you, unsolicited, out of the blue to say that it has reset your password. If you are a Twitter user and you receive a weird direct message that wants you to go to a Twitter log-in page, you should not provide your log-in information -- it&apos;s a scam! And, finally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. does not contact individual bank users to tell them that their banks have failed. The FDIC never sends unsolicited e-mail and its URL does not end with what is obviously another domain name. Following the link will download a Trojan that turns your computer into a bot.

8. Report: Former AMD CEO Ruiz was source in scandal: The stunning news of the week was a Wall Street Journal report that former Advanced Micro Devices CEO Hector Ruiz allegedly shared confidential information with a Wall Street trader involved in an insider-trading scandal.

9. Yahoo, Microsoft need more time to close ad search deal: Another round from the story that refuses to go away -- Yahoo and Microsoft have not been able to finalize their ad-search deal by a set deadline, so they have extended the deadline for an unspecified period. (There&apos;s a trick we would like to try with some of our deadlines.)

10. Come as you aren&apos;t: 10 geek costumes for Halloween and Halloween treats at Network World: Oh, to be sure there was other IT news this week of note, but Saturday is Halloween and we&apos;re in the mood for a little fun.

    <body>* Yushchenko wage decision stirs strong words from IMF

* Ratings agency sees adverse impact from decision

(Adds analysts, CDS, quotes, Putin)

By Sabina Zawadzki

KIEV, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko signed a bill on Friday that would raise the minimum wage by over 20 percent -- a move the International Monetary Fund chief said pushed its $16.4 billion bailout &quot;off-track&quot;.

Uncertainty over IMF funding for Ukraine, one of Europe&apos;s worst performing economies, prompted credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s to cut its outlook to &quot;stable&quot; from &quot;positive&quot;, while Fitch said the wage rises would pressure its own already low &apos;B&apos; rating. [ID:nLU676442]

Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has said the wage rises would place &quot;an atom bomb under the finances of the country&quot; and would cost an extra $10 billion.

But Yushchenko told reporters: &quot;I would like to inform you that I have signed the bill.&quot;

Analysts have said the issue has become a political football ahead of a Jan. 17 presidential election in which Yushchenko, his bitter rival Tymoshenko and former premier Viktor Yanukovich will run.

IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn reacted to Yushchenko&apos;s decision swiftly, telling Reuters it concerned him greatly.

&quot;I&apos;m very worried by the president&apos;s agreement to this bill which puts the programme we had signed off track and in this situation I&apos;m afraid it would be very difficult to complete the next review of the programme,&quot; he said by telephone.

&quot;That&apos;s why we are going to continue working with the Ukrainian authorities in the hope they can come together again to reach a position which would comply with the technical agreement we signed with the government.&quot;

The government has said it simply cannot afford the extra spending. As its revenues plummet, it has maintained social benefits but has also had to help state energy firm Naftogaz to pay billions for Russian gas imports.

Yushchenko and Tymoshenko have been embroiled in a fierce rivalry for 18 months that has blocked privatisations, delayed policy-making and once before hobbled the IMF programme.

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Friday Ukraine could have problems with its gas bills, raising the spectre of a repeat of January&apos;s row when Moscow cut gas supplies to Ukraine, affecting thousands in Europe. [ID:nLU635960] [ID:nLU335258]

WORLD&apos;S RISKIEST DEBT

The IMF expects the economy to contract by up to 15 percent this year after industries ground to a virtual halt, steel exports plunged and the hryvnia currency lost over 60 percent last year, knocking the banking sector off balance.

S&amp;P said the uncertainty over the IMF would sap investor confidence in the banking system and would also pressure the hryvnia. The currency was little changed on Friday at 8.095-8.195 a dollar. Last May it hit a peak of 4.474/$.

&quot;Recent politically driven proposals to increase social expenditures imply a consolidated public sector deficit ... in excess of 10 percent of gross domestic product for 2009, which also reflects below-budgeted revenue collection,&quot; it said in a statement.

Analysts warned that if the increases come into force, the government would either pressure the central bank to print cash or be forced to raise already sky-high yields of over 27 percent on its domestic bonds to cover this year&apos;s budget gap.

Foreign debt insurance costs show Ukraine&apos;s debt to be the riskiest in the world with a 52 percent probability of default.

Credit default swaps are quoted at a mid-price of 1200 basis points which means it costs $1.2 million a year to insure $10 million of debt against default or restructuring over five years.

In theory, Yushchenko&apos;s signature brings the law into force, but the government has said it would contest it in court.

Yushchenko chose to announce his move as Tymoshenko unveiled sweeping measures to combat a feared epidemic of the H1N1 swine flu, in which one person has died.

Yushchenko, underscoring the perilous state of the country&apos;s finances, said Ukraine would turn to international institutions and foreign partners for help to buy medical supplies if Ukraine could not find the cash itself.

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Coventry Health Care Inc (CVH.N) posted lower third-quarter net income on Friday, hurt by a charge tied to a sale, but the results topped analysts&apos; forecasts as profit margins improved at its commercial health plans serving employers.

Coventry, which is recovering after posting disappointing results last year, also raised its full-year forecast.

But the company&apos;s shares lost their gains after Coventry said on a conference call that Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin would leave at the end of the year. The stock fell 1.4 percent.

&quot;Given some of the cost issues we&apos;re seeing across the industry, people were more jumpy given unexpected events than would otherwise be the case,&quot; Collins Stewart analyst Brian Wright said.

Chief Executive Officer Allen Wise said on the conference call that the mutual decision of Guertin&apos;s departure came after the CFO, who has held the position for five years, told him 2008 had been difficult and took a toll on him and his family.

John Stelben, senior vice president for finance, will assume the job on an interim basis.

&quot;While from a company standpoint, I believe ... that the company would be better off if Shawn remained in his position, I have to respect what is best for him and his family, and I understand his priorities,&quot; Wise said on the call.

Third-quarter net income fell to $70.6 million, or 48 cents per share, from $85.5 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding charges from the sale of its First Health Services subsidiary, earnings of 66 cents were 12 cents above the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 17.4 percent to $3.44 billion. Analysts looked for $3.48 billion.

Coventry follows larger rivals in posting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. The industry&apos;s shares remain pressured by the potential fallout of healthcare reform under debate in Congress.

Several companies have reported worrying cost trends stemming from the H1N1 flu and Cobra insurance for people who lost their jobs.

Sanford Bernstein analyst Ana Gupte said Coventry&apos;s better-than-expected commercial medical cost results should somewhat alleviate investor concerns about such spikes &quot;and have a positive read-across for the group.&quot;

The results also show the &quot;company continues to make progress toward its turnaround,&quot; Gupte said in a research note.

In its commercial plans for employers, Coventry spent 82.1 percent of its premium revenue on medical costs, less than 82.3 percent a year earlier.

For all its plans, medical costs rose to 84.4 percent of premiums from 83.8 percent, but were less than the 85.6 percent expected by Wells Fargo analyst Matt Perry.

&quot;The outperformance in the quarter was from better commercial margins -- which is a good sign that their re-pricing continues to gain traction,&quot; Perry said in a research note.

Coventry boosted its full-year earnings forecast, excluding items, to a range of $2.01 to $2.03 per share, from its prior outlook of $1.85 to $1.95.

Coventry shares were down 29 cents at $20.62 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)</body>

    <body>SOFIA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - These are some of the main stories in Bulgarian newspapers on Friday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

GENERAL AND POLITICS

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fear of adverse events such as miscarriages, rare neurological conditions and ordinary heart attacks will discourage some people from participating in mass vaccination efforts to fight swine flu, but public health experts said on Friday they could fight back with statistics.

Vaccination against pandemic H1N1 is underway in the United States, Britain, Canada and China and will start in other countries soon. And many people will associate bad events with the vaccine, said Dr. Steven Black of Cincinnati Children&apos;s Hospital in Ohio and colleagues.

&quot;Highly visible health conditions, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, spontaneous abortion or even death will occur in coincident temporal association with novel influenza vaccination,&quot; they wrote in the Lancet medical journal.

So they calculated what might be expected anyway, even if there were no vaccination campaign.

&quot;On the basis of the reviewed data, if a cohort of 10 million individuals was vaccinated in the UK, 21.5 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and 5.75 cases of sudden death would be expected to occur within 6 weeks of vaccination,&quot; they wrote.

For every 1 million pregnant women vaccinated, 397 will have a miscarriage, known medically as a spontaneous abortion, within a day -- all unrelated to the vaccine, they said.

&quot;If millions of people are vaccinated then just by chance we can expect bad things to happen to some of them, whether it&apos;s a diagnosis of autism or a miscarriage,&quot; commented David Spiegelhalter, a specialist in risk understanding at Britain&apos;s University of Cambridge.

&quot;By being ready with the expected numbers of chance cases, perhaps we can avoid over-reaction to sad, but coincidental, events. And why don&apos;t we ever see a headline &apos;Man wins lottery after flu jab&apos;?&quot;

Global health officials have set up various systems for monitoring such adverse events to make sure the vaccine is not causing any particular health problems.

But they know many people will blame miscarriages or other health disasters on the vaccine.

&quot;Widespread beliefs that such false associations are true can and do disrupt immunization programs, often to the detriment of public health,&quot; Black&apos;s team noted.

&quot;For example,&quot; they wrote, &quot;when an association between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and risk of autism was made, it had a negative effect on public uptake of measles prevention programs in the UK and elsewhere, with a consequent rise in morbidity (sickness) and mortality due to measles.&quot;

Fears about polio vaccines have disrupted efforts to eradicate the paralyzing virus in Nigeria, they added.

People have special fears about Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS). a rare neurological condition that was linked to a 1976 U.S. swine flu vaccination campaign. Although no case of GBS was ever linked to the vaccine, a belief that the vaccine was worse than the illness remains widespread.

At any given time in the United States, one or two cases of GBS will be seen among any 1 million people in a given month.

If 100 million people are vaccinated, during the six weeks following 200 or more cases of GBS will be seen, completely independent of vaccination they said.

Only if this number goes over 200 should health officials start to be alarmed, they said.

 (Adds comments by CEO, CFO and analysts, other background,
updates stock activity) By Jessica Wohl CHICAGO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N)
reported a much higher than expected jump in quarterly profit
and raised its 2010 forecast as department stores stocked up on
its new products and the cosmetics maker cut back on spending. While the company is gaining market share, it still has a
cautious take on the economy and consumer spending ahead of
what could be a lackluster holiday season. Estee is also
tracking the potential impact of the H1N1 flu on business,
particularly for highly profitable travel-related sales. Estee Lauder is taking steps such as introducing smaller
bottles of certain fragrances for $29.50, a $10 reduction from
the previous entry price, to attract cost-conscious shoppers,
Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda said on a conference call. &quot;Within the premium space they have great brands, and
brands that while higher-priced, are not ultra higher-priced,&quot;
said JP Morgan analyst John Faucher. &quot;Also, they&apos;re doing a
great job internationally.&quot; First-quarter sales fell 3.7 percent to $1.83 billion,
topping analysts&apos; expectations of $1.82 billion, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Some of the upside came from sales at duty-free shops and
growth in Asia. Sales rose 12.4 percent in the Asia/Pacific
region, excluding currency fluctuations, while they fell 4.1
percent in the larger Americas region. Skin care sales increased, driven by new products that were
launched with little need for advertising spending. Sales of
makeup, perfume and other products declined. Estee Lauder previously said some holiday season orders
came earlier than anticipated, which helped first-quarter
results. Shares of Estee Lauder, known for its namesake line and
other brands such as Clinique, were up $3.70 or 9 percent at
$44.84 in early afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
Earlier in the session, the shares touched a 12-month peak of
$45.44. TOPPING EXPECTATIONS Two weeks ago, Estee Lauder said profit for the first
quarter ended on Sept. 30 would come in significantly higher
than forecast and that it would raise its annual view.
[ID:nN16233938] Estee Lauder earned $140.7 million, or 71 cents per share,
in its first quarter, up from $51.1 million, or 26 cents per
share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring items, Estee Lauder earned 85 cents
per share. In August, it had forecast a profit of 23 to 30
cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 34 cents. &quot;While satisfying, these strong results should not mask the
challenges and uncertainties we still see in the global
economic environment,&quot; Freda said. Estee Lauder benefited from a number of items unique to the
quarter, such as strong sales of new items such as Advanced
Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex product, which was
not backed by advertising spending, analysts noted. &quot;Future quarters won&apos;t be characterized by all the good
one-time things that happened in this one,&quot; said BMO Capital
Markets analyst Connie Maneaty. The company now expects to earn $1.95 to $2.10 per share
this year, up from its August forecast of $1.55 to $1.70.
Analysts on average had forecast $1.79. &quot;I would argue that the guidance seems a little
conservative unless something does in fact go wrong,&quot; said
Faucher. The travel-related business, which includes sales in
airport shops, rang up about 9 percent of sales in the quarter,
up from their historical level of about 7 percent. Such sales
account for about 20 percent of Estee Lauder&apos;s profit, Chief
Financial Officer Richard Kunes said on a conference call. The results came a day after cosmetics makers such as Avon
Products Inc (AVP.N), Elizabeth Arden Inc (RDEN.O) and Revlon
Inc (REV.N) posted a mixed bag of quarterly results.
[ID:nN29362588] Estee Lauder said second-quarter sales should be flat to up
3 percent in constant currency, with earnings of 80 to 87 cents
per share before restructuring charges. Analysts were looking
for a profit of 85 cents. The company still expects fiscal 2010 sales to be flat to
up 2 percent in constant currency. &quot;It&apos;s prudent of them to be conservative on the sales line,
for sure,&quot; said Maneaty. &quot;Once we get past the flu season and
as the economy picks up I think a measure of optimism can work
its way into sales, but it&apos;s too soon to call it now.&quot;

NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Coventry Health Care Inc (CVH.N) posted lower third-quarter net income on Friday, hurt by a charge tied to a sale, but the results topped analysts&apos; forecasts as profit margins improved at its commercial health plans serving employers.

Coventry, which is recovering after posting disappointing results last year, also raised its full-year forecast.

But the company&apos;s shares lost their gains after Coventry said on a conference call that Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin would leave at the end of the year. The stock fell 1.4 percent.

&quot;Given some of the cost issues we&apos;re seeing across the industry, people were more jumpy given unexpected events than would otherwise be the case,&quot; Collins Stewart analyst Brian Wright said.

Chief Executive Officer Allen Wise said on the conference call that the mutual decision of Guertin&apos;s departure came after the CFO, who has held the position for five years, told him 2008 had been difficult and took a toll on him and his family.

John Stelben, senior vice president for finance, will assume the job on an interim basis.

&quot;While from a company standpoint, I believe ... that the company would be better off if Shawn remained in his position, I have to respect what is best for him and his family, and I understand his priorities,&quot; Wise said on the call.

Third-quarter net income fell to $70.6 million, or 48 cents per share, from $85.5 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding charges from the sale of its First Health Services subsidiary, earnings of 66 cents were 12 cents above the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 17.4 percent to $3.44 billion. Analysts looked for $3.48 billion.

Coventry follows larger rivals in posting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. The industry&apos;s shares remain pressured by the potential fallout of healthcare reform under debate in Congress.

    <body>PARIS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) raised its outlook for 2009 thanks to sales of swine flu vaccines and posted earnings per share growth that beat forecasts as the arrival of some generics was offset by growth in other drugs.

Sanofi expected H1N1 vaccines to add about $500 million to its sales in the fourth quarter and predicted adjusted earnings per share excluding items to grow by around 11 percent at constant exchange rates instead of around 10 percent before.

EPS in the third quarter beat expectations, increasing 16.3 percent to 1.71 euros, in part thanks to continued cost cutting. The average outcome of a Reuters poll among 15 analysts was for EPS of 1.61 euros. Sales just missed consensus, up 8 percent at 7.4 billion rather than to 7.44 billion.

    <body>* Expects 6 million people vaccinated by end of next week

* Says can&apos;t expect everyone to get shots immediately

* Vaccine output now a little slower than hoped for

OTTAWA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Canada&apos;s top health officials, responding to criticism over the speed at which they are rolling out vaccines for H1N1 swine flu, said on Friday that one in five or six Canadians should have their shots by the end of next week.

Vaccinations began this week, and Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones said he expected that by next weekend six million Canadians would have received shots.

Canada has ordered more than enough vaccine for each of its more than 33 million people from GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), but the death in the last week of a teenager and a 10-year-old girl has made many eager to get shots as soon as possible.

Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said it was unrealistic to expect the whole country to get shots immediately.

&quot;This is a challenging task, the challenge of providing vaccines to 30 million people is a huge challenge. We are into Day 5,&quot; she said.

The authorities got a week&apos;s head start on their original plan of starting vaccinations in the first week of November, but they said GlaxoSmithKline was not able to roll out the vaccines as quickly as originally hoped.

The company has delivered about 2 million doses a week, 2/3 of what had been expected, and will deliver less than 1 million next week, but the expectation is still that everybody who wants a shot will get one by Christmas.

As for whether trick-or-treaters should stay home on Saturday night instead of going out for Halloween candy, Butler-Jones had this advice: &quot;If children are sick, they shouldn&apos;t go trick-or-treating. I think this is common sense. If they&apos;re not sick, though, there&apos;s no reason to prevent them going out.&quot; (Reporting by Randall Palmer; Editing by Frank McGurty)</body>

    <body>Oct 30 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- Hydro-Quebec&apos;s takeover of New Brunswick Power amounts to a virtual power monopoly in Eastern Canada and poses &quot;a very dangerous situation&quot; for the entire country, Newfoundland Premier Danny Williams warns.

- The federal government has warned the provinces they will receive less H1N1 vaccine than promised, forcing health-care clinics across the country to delay the rollout of their pandemic programs to the general public just as demand soars.

- A landmark report on the economic impact of meeting climate-change targets has run into a storm of opposition, with Western provinces calling it divisive and the federal government saying it would spell economic disaster.

Federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice said there is no way Western Canadians could absorb the deep economic hit projected by the report&apos;s environmentalist authors -- the David Suzuki Foundation and the Pembina Institute.

BUSINESS:

- Globalive Wireless Management Corp&apos;s fight to be Canada&apos;s next big cellphone company appears headed to the federal government.

After the country&apos;s telecom regulator said the wireless hopeful is in violation of federal ownership rules, Globalive is expected to appeal the decision directly to the federal cabinet, according to sources in Ottawa.

NATIONAL POST:

- The fugitive son of an Imam shot dead by U.S. federal agents Wednesday was arrested Thursday in downtown Windsor and in the custody Canadian border authorities, the FBI said in a statement.

Mujahid Carswell, 30, also known as Mujahid Abdullah, was arrested by RCMP officers at about 1 p.m. Thursday without incident after police blocked off a downtown street and surrounded a house with a tactical team.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Policy makers have reminded us ad nauseam about how well positioned Canada is, vis-a-vis its industrialized peers, in dealing with the global economic downturn because of this country&apos;s sound fiscal framework.

But the country may be reaching a point at which the bragging needs to cool down.

- While the U.S. economy exited its worst postwar recession with stronger than expected growth in the third quarter, analysts say the Federal Reserve is unlikely to upset the fragile recovery with any talk of rate rises at its meeting next week, the market&apos;s next obsession.

- Canadian stocks snapped a four-day losing streak and raced back above 11,000 on Thursday as south of the border the world&apos;s biggest economy confirmed that its worst postwar recession has ended.</body>

Could the H1N1 flu virus give networks a bad case of congestion? It could if workers and students are forced to stay home because of the pandemic.

Officials at the U.S. Government Accountability Office weighed in on the potential for clogged networks Monday in a 71-page report (a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d108.pdf&quot;&gt;download PDF); Gartner Inc. analysts reiterated the GAO&apos;s concerns yesterday.

Although the issue has been raised before by various ISPs and network carriers, recent worries have focused on securities firms that depend on third parties to clear trades and process payments over the Internet, according to the GAO. &quot;Internet congestion during a severe pandemic that hampers teleworkers is anticipated, but responsible government agencies have not developed plans to to address such congestion and may lack clear authority to act,&quot; the GAO warned.

Gartner picked up that GAO theme and offered some technical tips for businesses grappling with the problem. Work-at-home strategies for organization &quot;may be in jeopardy as residential Internet bandwidth supply may not meet demand,&quot; Gartner said.

Both Gartner and the GAO, as well as other groups, have consulted with ISPs, carriers and large carrier consortiums on this issue, and have noted that Internet backbone congestion from a pandemic is not a major concern. The larger problem may be with the network &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;last mile&quot; in the residential portion of the Internet.

The last mile is a generic name often used for the wired connections between homes and carrier switching offices, often a mile or so away from a group of homes.

Al Berman, executive director of the Disaster Recovery Institute in New York, agreed, saying there could be congestion problems for workers who work at home without the right equipment. He urged companies to do stress testing on their private networks.

Gartner said that dozens of residential DSL users could share a single DSLAM connection at the carrier&apos;s switching office to reach the backbone, contributing to congestion problems. &quot;Last-mile DSL and cable modem networks are where remote access falls apart,&quot; said John Girard, a Gartner analyst. &quot;Backbones will be affected [some], but the network edge will crash.&quot;

While the network edge impact would vary by neighborhood, Gartner based its comments on a Centers for Disease Control planning guideline that assumes 40% of the workforce might not be in the workplace for an extended period of time during a pandemic.

Gartner suggested three ways businesses can improve bandwidth for work-at-home employees during a pandemic:

* Consider deploying WAN optimization controller software on every laptop used at home to mitigate bandwidth and latency problems. Such software can reduce the bandwidth needed for many applications by 80% to 90%.
* Install client applets that work with data center application delivery controllers or with WAN optimization controller software to reduce network performance bottlenecks.
* Bypass the wired last mile by switching to a wireless connection such as 3G or Wimax or satellite. Even so, Gartner said to assume that wireless services might also be overused in an emergency.

In certain ways, Gartner went further than the GAO in airing concerns about network readiness, although the focus of Gartner&apos;s comments was on businesses -- not how the government should work with businesses.

Gartner analyst Roberta Witty said that current work-at-home strategies being implemented by organizations to deal with pandemic-related network congestion &quot;will likely not work&quot; in a true emergency. She recommended that IT groups work with network service providers to decide in advance which business operations require heavy Internet use. Companies may even need to stagger hours of operation to increase chances of getting needed bandwidth.

The GAO&apos;s report is far borader, and indicates that service providers could add extra network capacity, install direct lines to businesses, temporarily reduce maximum transmission rates or shut down some Internet sites. But all those methods are limited by technical difficulties and whether the government has the authority to insist on such moves.

The GAO asked several government agencies to comment on its report, and included a response from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that went on for several pages. In one portion, DHS urged all Internet users, including financial services, to develop pandemic contingency plans.

&quot;An expectation of unlimited Internet access during a pandemic is not realistic, any more so than an expectation that traffic congestion on hurricane evacuation routes can be completely avoided,&quot; the DHS wrote. &quot;All users which rely on the Internet, including the financial services sector, should not expect that Internet congestion problems will be easily solved....&quot;

* Cases of disease expected regardless of jabs

* Vaccine &quot;myths&quot; damage vaccination efforts

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Fear of adverse events such as miscarriages, rare neurological conditions and ordinary heart attacks will discourage some people from participating in mass vaccination efforts to fight swine flu, but public health experts said on Friday they could fight back with statistics.

Vaccination against pandemic H1N1 is underway in the United States, Britain, Canada and China and will start in other countries soon. And many people will associate bad events with the vaccine, said Dr. Steven Black of Cincinnati Children&apos;s Hospital in Ohio and colleagues.

&quot;Highly visible health conditions, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, spontaneous abortion or even death will occur in coincident temporal association with novel influenza vaccination,&quot; they wrote in the Lancet medical journal.

So they calculated what might be expected anyway, even if there were no vaccination campaign.

&quot;On the basis of the reviewed data, if a cohort of 10 million individuals was vaccinated in the UK, 21.5 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and 5.75 cases of sudden death would be expected to occur within 6 weeks of vaccination,&quot; they wrote.

For every 1 million pregnant women vaccinated, 397 will have a miscarriage, known medically as a spontaneous abortion, within a day -- all unrelated to the vaccine, they said.

&quot;If millions of people are vaccinated then just by chance we can expect bad things to happen to some of them, whether it&apos;s a diagnosis of autism or a miscarriage,&quot; commented David Spiegelhalter, a specialist in risk undertstanding at Britain&apos;s University of Cambridge.

&quot;By being ready with the expected numbers of chance cases, perhaps we can avoid over-reaction to sad, but coincidental, events. And why don&apos;t we ever see a headline &apos;Man wins lottery after flu jab&apos;?&quot;

Global health officials have set up various systems for monitoring such adverse events to make sure the vaccine is not causing any particular health problems.

But they know many people will blame miscarriages or other health disasters on the vaccine.

&quot;Widespread beliefs that such false associations are true can and do disrupt immunization programs, often to the detriment of public health,&quot; Black&apos;s team noted.

&quot;For example,&quot; they wrote, &quot;when an association between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and risk of autism was made, it had a negative effect on public uptake of measles prevention programs in the UK and elsewhere, with a consequent rise in morbidity (sickness) and mortality due to measles.&quot;

Fears about polio vaccines have disrupted efforts to eradicate the paralyzing virus in Nigeria, they added.

People have special fears about Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS). a rare neurological condition that was linked to a 1976 U.S. swine flu vaccination campaign. Although no case of GBS was ever linked to the vaccine, a belief that the vaccine was worse than the illness remains widespread.

At any given time in the United States, one or two cases of GBS will be seen among any 1 million people in a given month.

If 100 million people are vaccinated, during the six weeks following 200 or more cases of GBS will be seen, completely independent of vaccination they said.

Only if this number goes over 200 should health officials start to be alarmed, they said. (Editing by Todd Eastham)</body>

    <body>By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) reported a much higher than expected jump in quarterly profit and raised its 2010 forecast as department stores stocked up on its new products and the cosmetics maker cut back on spending.

While the company is gaining market share, it still has a cautious take on the economy and consumer spending ahead of what could be a lackluster holiday season. Estee is also tracking the potential impact of the H1N1 flu on business, particularly for highly profitable travel-related sales.

Estee Lauder is taking steps such as introducing smaller bottles of certain fragrances for $29.50, a $10 reduction from the previous entry price, to attract cost-conscious shoppers, Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda said on a conference call.

&quot;Within the premium space they have great brands, and brands that while higher-priced, are not ultra higher-priced,&quot; said JP Morgan analyst John Faucher. &quot;Also, they&apos;re doing a great job internationally.&quot;

First-quarter sales fell 3.7 percent to $1.83 billion, topping analysts&apos; expectations of $1.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Some of the upside came from sales at duty-free shops and growth in Asia. Sales rose 12.4 percent in the Asia/Pacific region, excluding currency fluctuations, while they fell 4.1 percent in the larger Americas region.

Skin care sales increased, driven by new products that were launched with little need for advertising spending. Sales of makeup, perfume and other products declined.

Estee Lauder previously said some holiday season orders came earlier than anticipated, which helped first-quarter results.

Shares of Estee Lauder, known for its namesake line and other brands such as Clinique, were up $3.70 or 9 percent at $44.84 in early afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the session, the shares touched a 12-month peak of $45.44.

TOPPING EXPECTATIONS

Two weeks ago, Estee Lauder said profit for the first quarter ended on September 30 would come in significantly higher than forecast and that it would raise its annual view.

Estee Lauder earned $140.7 million, or 71 cents per share, in its first quarter, up from $51.1 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring items, Estee Lauder earned 85 cents per share. In August, it had forecast a profit of 23 to 30 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 34 cents.

&quot;While satisfying, these strong results should not mask the challenges and uncertainties we still see in the global economic environment,&quot; Freda said.

Estee Lauder benefited from a number of items unique to the quarter, such as strong sales of new items such as Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex product, which was not backed by advertising spending, analysts noted.

&quot;Future quarters won&apos;t be characterized by all the good one-time things that happened in this one,&quot; said BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty.

The company now expects to earn $1.95 to $2.10 per share this year, up from its August forecast of $1.55 to $1.70. Analysts on average had forecast $1.79.

&quot;I would argue that the guidance seems a little conservative unless something does in fact go wrong,&quot; said Faucher.

The travel-related business, which includes sales in airport shops, rang up about 9 percent of sales in the quarter, up from their historical level of about 7 percent. Such sales account for about 20 percent of Estee Lauder&apos;s profit, Chief Financial Officer Richard Kunes said on a conference call.

The results came a day after cosmetics makers such as Avon Products Inc (AVP.N), Elizabeth Arden Inc (RDEN.O) and Revlon Inc (REV.N) posted a mixed bag of quarterly results.

Estee Lauder said second-quarter sales should be flat to up 3 percent in constant currency, with earnings of 80 to 87 cents per share before restructuring charges. Analysts were looking for a profit of 85 cents.

The company still expects fiscal 2010 sales to be flat to up 2 percent in constant currency.

&quot;It&apos;s prudent of them to be conservative on the sales line, for sure,&quot; said Maneaty. &quot;Once we get past the flu season and as the economy picks up I think a measure of optimism can work its way into sales, but it&apos;s too soon to call it now.&quot;

* Experts warn of H1N1 flu surges as pilgrims return

* Saudi ministry advises young, old, sick to stay home

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Waves of H1N1 swine flu spread by some three million pilgrims travelling to and from Mecca for next month&apos;s haj threaten to pile pressure on healthcare systems around the world, disease experts said on Thursday.

&quot;No region can be considered free from risk,&quot; said the U.S. and Arab experts, including Saudia Arabia&apos;s deputy minister for preventative medicine, in a study in the journal Science.

The pilgrimage itself, in the last week of November, provides perfect conditions for the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, which is transmitted in droplets and by physical contact.

&quot;The density of pilgrims, the nature of the rituals, and the shoulder-to-shoulder contact recommended during prayers provide a perfect transmission atmosphere,&quot; wrote Shahul Ebrahim of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Ziad Memish of Saudi Arabia&apos;s health ministry.

Around 3 million pilgrims from more than 160 countries take part in the haj in the holy city of Mecca most years, including up to 2 million who travel from abroad.

Memish and Ebrahim also said that after the event, around 45,000 pilgrims from Europe and more than 15,000 from North America will pass though major global airline hubs on their way home, further increasing the risk of spreading the virus.

&quot;Haj-related exportation of H1N1 virus by returning pilgrims could potentially initiate waves of outbreaks worldwide and burden health care systems,&quot; they wrote.

In an audio interview published with the research, Ebrahim said previous studies had shown &quot;at least 30 to 35 percent spread of respiratory infections&quot; during the haj.

&quot;This year, because of the high levels of morbidity with H1N1 ... we are trying to be highly alert and highly prepared.&quot;

SOME PILGRIMS TOLD &quot;STAY AT HOME&quot;

Health authorities have stopped counting the number of people who have caught swine flu but say many millions are likely to have been infected since it began to spread around the world in March.

It was declared a pandemic in June, and according to the World Health Organisation, as of Oct. 17 there were nearly 5,000 reported deaths worldwide from H1N1.

Arab health ministers agreed in July that they would try to prevent people aged over 65 and under 12 from travelling to Mecca for the haj, and several Muslim countries have advised pilgrims not to go this year. [ID:nLT239445]

Memish said authorities were also advising pregnant women and those with health risk factors such as diabetes, chronic heart, lung or kidney problems to stay at home.

Jeddah&apos;s haj airport terminal, as well as sea ports and nearby airports, will have thermal sensors operating to check pilgrims and extra medical staff will be in place.

But the study&apos;s authors said such measures may be only partly effective, since some H1N1 infected travellers may not yet be showing symptoms when they arrive, and others may contract the virus without getting a fever.

Ebrahim noted efforts by Saudi authorities to ensure &quot;surge capacity&quot; in hospitals in Jeddah and urged governments in pilgrims&apos; home countries to do the same.

&quot;Resource-poor countries will need political will and external support to ensure availability of resources and logistics,&quot; they said. &quot;After Haj, surge capacity for returning pilgrims who might be ill should be ensured.&quot;</body>

By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - As many as 5.7 million Americans were infected with the H1N1 virus between April and late July, U.S. researchers said on Thursday, offering the clearest picture yet of how quickly and widely swine flu can spread.

Researchers used computer models to estimate the number of people who have contracted swine flu, which began infecting Americans in April.

They estimated that 1.8 million to 5.7 million cases of swine flu occurred between April and July 23, sending between 9,000 and 20,000 people to the hospital.

About 6 percent of people who were hospitalized with the virus died, the team, led by Carrie Reed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

This suggests that as many as 1,300 people died from their infections between April and July. Officially, 1,000 U.S. deaths have been attributed to H1N1 since April.

Dr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC said on Thursday the agency does not have an update beyond July 24.

&quot;We do believe many millions of people have already contracted this virus in the United States,&quot; Schuchat said.

&quot;It&apos;s probably now well more than 20,000 hospitalizations,&quot; she said. &quot;Really, the priority is to minimize illness and death.&quot;

Part of the U.S. plan to do that was through widespread vaccinations, but manufacturing delays have stalled those efforts. &quot;We had all hoped to have more vaccine now than we have,&quot; Schuchat said.

Earlier government estimates had suggested there would be as many as 40 million vaccine doses available for state and local health authorities to distribute by the end of October.

Schuchat said 24.8 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine are available, 1.6 million more doses than on Wednesday.

The United States has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

Except for MedImmune, all had problems making vaccine at first and are still struggling to make the virus grow in eggs, the first step to manufacturing influenza vaccine.

Schuchat said state and local health departments have had to adapt their vaccination plans to cope with the delays, and dole out a limited number of doses to people at greatest risk of developing severe disease from H1N1, including people with underlying health conditions and women who are pregnant.

Several studies released at the meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America in Philadelphiaon Thursday showed that vaccinating pregnant women protected their babies, also.

They said babies were less likely to be premature and were bigger if their mothers were vaccinated against flu. [ID:nN29244519]

A separate study showed that people who had been taking cholesterol lowering drugs called statins were less likely to die from flu. [ID:nN29369359] (Additional reporting by Maggie Fox in Washington; Editing by Doina Chiacu)</body>

    <body>Oct 30 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- Hydro-Quebec&apos;s takeover of New Brunswick Power amounts to a virtual power monopoly in Eastern Canada and poses &quot;a very dangerous situation&quot; for the entire country, Newfoundland Premier Danny Williams warns.

- The federal government has warned the provinces they will receive less H1N1 vaccine than promised, forcing health-care clinics across the country to delay the rollout of their pandemic programs to the general public just as demand soars.

- A landmark report on the economic impact of meeting climate-change targets has run into a storm of opposition, with Western provinces calling it divisive and the federal government saying it would spell economic disaster.

Federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice said there is no way Western Canadians could absorb the deep economic hit projected by the report&apos;s environmentalist authors -- the David Suzuki Foundation and the Pembina Institute.

BUSINESS:

- Globalive Wireless Management Corp&apos;s fight to be Canada&apos;s next big cellphone company appears headed to the federal government.

After the country&apos;s telecom regulator said the wireless hopeful is in violation of federal ownership rules, Globalive is expected to appeal the decision directly to the federal cabinet, according to sources in Ottawa.

NATIONAL POST:

- The fugitive son of an Imam shot dead by U.S. federal agents Wednesday was arrested Thursday in downtown Windsor and in the custody Canadian border authorities, the FBI said in a statement.

Mujahid Carswell, 30, also known as Mujahid Abdullah, was arrested by RCMP officers at about 1 p.m. Thursday without incident after police blocked off a downtown street and surrounded a house with a tactical team.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Policy makers have reminded us ad nauseam about how well positioned Canada is, vis-a-vis its industrialized peers, in dealing with the global economic downturn because of this country&apos;s sound fiscal framework.

But the country may be reaching a point at which the bragging needs to cool down.

- While the U.S. economy exited its worst postwar recession with stronger than expected growth in the third quarter, analysts say the Federal Reserve is unlikely to upset the fragile recovery with any talk of rate rises at its meeting next week, the market&apos;s next obsession.

- Canadian stocks snapped a four-day losing streak and raced back above 11,000 on Thursday as south of the border the world&apos;s biggest economy confirmed that its worst postwar recession has ended.</body>

Could the H1N1 flu virus give networks a bad case of congestion? It could if workers and students are forced to stay home because of the pandemic.

Officials at the U.S. Government Accountability Office weighed in on the potential for clogged networks Monday in a 71-page report (a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d108.pdf&quot;&gt;download PDF); Gartner Inc. analysts reiterated the GAO&apos;s concerns yesterday.

WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Fear of adverse events such as miscarriages, rare neurological conditions and ordinary heart attacks will discourage some people from participating in mass vaccination efforts to fight swine flu, but public health experts said on Friday they could fight back with statistics.

Vaccination against pandemic H1N1 is underway in the United States, Britain, Canada and China and will start in other countries soon. And many people will associate bad events with the vaccine, said Dr. Steven Black of Cincinnati Children&apos;s Hospital in Ohio and colleagues.

&quot;On the basis of the reviewed data, if a cohort of 10 million individuals was vaccinated in the UK, 21.5 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and 5.75 cases of sudden death would be expected to occur within 6 weeks of vaccination,&quot; they wrote.

For every 1 million pregnant women vaccinated, 397 will have a miscarriage, known medically as a spontaneous abortion, within a day -- all unrelated to the vaccine, they said.

&quot;If millions of people are vaccinated then just by chance we can expect bad things to happen to some of them, whether it&apos;s a diagnosis of autism or a miscarriage,&quot; commented David Spiegelhalter, a specialist in risk undertstanding at Britain&apos;s University of Cambridge.

&quot;By being ready with the expected numbers of chance cases, perhaps we can avoid over-reaction to sad, but coincidental, events. And why don&apos;t we ever see a headline &apos;Man wins lottery after flu jab&apos;?&quot;

Global health officials have set up various systems for monitoring such adverse events to make sure the vaccine is not causing any particular health problems.

But they know many people will blame miscarriages or other health disasters on the vaccine.

&quot;Widespread beliefs that such false associations are true can and do disrupt immunization programs, often to the detriment of public health,&quot; Black&apos;s team noted.

&quot;For example,&quot; they wrote, &quot;when an association between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and risk of autism was made, it had a negative effect on public uptake of measles prevention programs in the UK and elsewhere, with a consequent rise in morbidity (sickness) and mortality due to measles.&quot;

Fears about polio vaccines have disrupted efforts to eradicate the paralyzing virus in Nigeria, they added.

People have special fears about Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS). a rare neurological condition that was linked to a 1976 U.S. swine flu vaccination campaign. Although no case of GBS was ever linked to the vaccine, a belief that the vaccine was worse than the illness remains widespread.

At any given time in the United States, one or two cases of GBS will be seen among any 1 million people in a given month.

If 100 million people are vaccinated, during the six weeks following 200 or more cases of GBS will be seen, completely independent of vaccination they said.

Only if this number goes over 200 should health officials start to be alarmed, they said. (Editing by Todd Eastham)</body>

    <body>By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) reported a much higher than expected jump in quarterly profit and raised its 2010 forecast as department stores stocked up on its new products and the cosmetics maker cut back on spending.

While the company is gaining market share, it still has a cautious take on the economy and consumer spending ahead of what could be a lackluster holiday season. Estee is also tracking the potential impact of the H1N1 flu on business, particularly for highly profitable travel-related sales.

Estee Lauder is taking steps such as introducing smaller bottles of certain fragrances for $29.50, a $10 reduction from the previous entry price, to attract cost-conscious shoppers, Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda said on a conference call.

&quot;Within the premium space they have great brands, and brands that while higher-priced, are not ultra higher-priced,&quot; said JP Morgan analyst John Faucher. &quot;Also, they&apos;re doing a great job internationally.&quot;

First-quarter sales fell 3.7 percent to $1.83 billion, topping analysts&apos; expectations of $1.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Some of the upside came from sales at duty-free shops and growth in Asia. Sales rose 12.4 percent in the Asia/Pacific region, excluding currency fluctuations, while they fell 4.1 percent in the larger Americas region.

Skin care sales increased, driven by new products that were launched with little need for advertising spending. Sales of makeup, perfume and other products declined.

Estee Lauder previously said some holiday season orders came earlier than anticipated, which helped first-quarter results.

Shares of Estee Lauder, known for its namesake line and other brands such as Clinique, were up $3.70 or 9 percent at $44.84 in early afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the session, the shares touched a 12-month peak of $45.44.

TOPPING EXPECTATIONS

Two weeks ago, Estee Lauder said profit for the first quarter ended on September 30 would come in significantly higher than forecast and that it would raise its annual view.

Estee Lauder earned $140.7 million, or 71 cents per share, in its first quarter, up from $51.1 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring items, Estee Lauder earned 85 cents per share. In August, it had forecast a profit of 23 to 30 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 34 cents.

&quot;While satisfying, these strong results should not mask the challenges and uncertainties we still see in the global economic environment,&quot; Freda said.

Estee Lauder benefited from a number of items unique to the quarter, such as strong sales of new items such as Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex product, which was not backed by advertising spending, analysts noted.

&quot;Future quarters won&apos;t be characterized by all the good one-time things that happened in this one,&quot; said BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty.

The company now expects to earn $1.95 to $2.10 per share this year, up from its August forecast of $1.55 to $1.70. Analysts on average had forecast $1.79.

&quot;I would argue that the guidance seems a little conservative unless something does in fact go wrong,&quot; said Faucher.

The travel-related business, which includes sales in airport shops, rang up about 9 percent of sales in the quarter, up from their historical level of about 7 percent. Such sales account for about 20 percent of Estee Lauder&apos;s profit, Chief Financial Officer Richard Kunes said on a conference call.

The results came a day after cosmetics makers such as Avon Products Inc (AVP.N), Elizabeth Arden Inc (RDEN.O) and Revlon Inc (REV.N) posted a mixed bag of quarterly results.

Estee Lauder said second-quarter sales should be flat to up 3 percent in constant currency, with earnings of 80 to 87 cents per share before restructuring charges. Analysts were looking for a profit of 85 cents.

The company still expects fiscal 2010 sales to be flat to up 2 percent in constant currency.

&quot;It&apos;s prudent of them to be conservative on the sales line, for sure,&quot; said Maneaty. &quot;Once we get past the flu season and as the economy picks up I think a measure of optimism can work its way into sales, but it&apos;s too soon to call it now.&quot;

* Experts warn of H1N1 flu surges as pilgrims return

* Saudi ministry advises young, old, sick to stay home

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Waves of H1N1 swine flu spread by some three million pilgrims travelling to and from Mecca for next month&apos;s haj threaten to pile pressure on healthcare systems around the world, disease experts said on Thursday.

&quot;No region can be considered free from risk,&quot; said the U.S. and Arab experts, including Saudia Arabia&apos;s deputy minister for preventative medicine, in a study in the journal Science.

The pilgrimage itself, in the last week of November, provides perfect conditions for the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, which is transmitted in droplets and by physical contact.

&quot;The density of pilgrims, the nature of the rituals, and the shoulder-to-shoulder contact recommended during prayers provide a perfect transmission atmosphere,&quot; wrote Shahul Ebrahim of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Ziad Memish of Saudi Arabia&apos;s health ministry.

Around 3 million pilgrims from more than 160 countries take part in the haj in the holy city of Mecca most years, including up to 2 million who travel from abroad.

Memish and Ebrahim also said that after the event, around 45,000 pilgrims from Europe and more than 15,000 from North America will pass though major global airline hubs on their way home, further increasing the risk of spreading the virus.

&quot;Haj-related exportation of H1N1 virus by returning pilgrims could potentially initiate waves of outbreaks worldwide and burden health care systems,&quot; they wrote.

In an audio interview published with the research, Ebrahim said previous studies had shown &quot;at least 30 to 35 percent spread of respiratory infections&quot; during the haj.

&quot;This year, because of the high levels of morbidity with H1N1 ... we are trying to be highly alert and highly prepared.&quot;

SOME PILGRIMS TOLD &quot;STAY AT HOME&quot;

Health authorities have stopped counting the number of people who have caught swine flu but say many millions are likely to have been infected since it began to spread around the world in March.

It was declared a pandemic in June, and according to the World Health Organisation, as of Oct. 17 there were nearly 5,000 reported deaths worldwide from H1N1.

Arab health ministers agreed in July that they would try to prevent people aged over 65 and under 12 from travelling to Mecca for the haj, and several Muslim countries have advised pilgrims not to go this year. [ID:nLT239445]

Memish said authorities were also advising pregnant women and those with health risk factors such as diabetes, chronic heart, lung or kidney problems to stay at home.

Jeddah&apos;s haj airport terminal, as well as sea ports and nearby airports, will have thermal sensors operating to check pilgrims and extra medical staff will be in place.

But the study&apos;s authors said such measures may be only partly effective, since some H1N1 infected travellers may not yet be showing symptoms when they arrive, and others may contract the virus without getting a fever.

Ebrahim noted efforts by Saudi authorities to ensure &quot;surge capacity&quot; in hospitals in Jeddah and urged governments in pilgrims&apos; home countries to do the same.

&quot;Resource-poor countries will need political will and external support to ensure availability of resources and logistics,&quot; they said. &quot;After Haj, surge capacity for returning pilgrims who might be ill should be ensured.&quot;</body>

By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - As many as 5.7 million Americans were infected with the H1N1 virus between April and late July, U.S. researchers said on Thursday, offering the clearest picture yet of how quickly and widely swine flu can spread.

Researchers used computer models to estimate the number of people who have contracted swine flu, which began infecting Americans in April.

They estimated that 1.8 million to 5.7 million cases of swine flu occurred between April and July 23, sending between 9,000 and 20,000 people to the hospital.

About 6 percent of people who were hospitalized with the virus died, the team, led by Carrie Reed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

This suggests that as many as 1,300 people died from their infections between April and July. Officially, 1,000 U.S. deaths have been attributed to H1N1 since April.

Dr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC said on Thursday the agency does not have an update beyond July 24.

&quot;We do believe many millions of people have already contracted this virus in the United States,&quot; Schuchat said.

&quot;It&apos;s probably now well more than 20,000 hospitalizations,&quot; she said. &quot;Really, the priority is to minimize illness and death.&quot;

Part of the U.S. plan to do that was through widespread vaccinations, but manufacturing delays have stalled those efforts. &quot;We had all hoped to have more vaccine now than we have,&quot; Schuchat said.

Earlier government estimates had suggested there would be as many as 40 million vaccine doses available for state and local health authorities to distribute by the end of October.

Schuchat said 24.8 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine are available, 1.6 million more doses than on Wednesday.

The United States has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

Except for MedImmune, all had problems making vaccine at first and are still struggling to make the virus grow in eggs, the first step to manufacturing influenza vaccine.

Schuchat said state and local health departments have had to adapt their vaccination plans to cope with the delays, and dole out a limited number of doses to people at greatest risk of developing severe disease from H1N1, including people with underlying health conditions and women who are pregnant.

Several studies released at the meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America in Philadelphiaon Thursday showed that vaccinating pregnant women protected their babies, also.

They said babies were less likely to be premature and were bigger if their mothers were vaccinated against flu. [ID:nN29244519]

A separate study showed that people who had been taking cholesterol lowering drugs called statins were less likely to die from flu. [ID:nN29369359] (Additional reporting by Maggie Fox in Washington; Editing by Doina Chiacu)</body>

ZURICH/LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Drugmakers say they are on track to deliver as much H1N1 swine flu vaccine to the United States as they promised, despite concerns over production.

The U.S. has contracted with its five suppliers of seasonal influenza vaccine to also deliver H1N1 vaccine, but officials have sharply cut initial estimates of how much will be delivered this month and next. [ID:nN27270273]

Many U.S. states and cities say they have received about a tenth as much vaccine as they had expected by this time, but Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) said they were on track to meet their commitments.

Most major vaccine producers have been struggling with low H1N1 yields, leading to lower-than-expected shipments and a scramble for supplies in some markets.

In September, U.S. officials said 40 million vaccine doses would be available by the end of October and they estimated 20 million doses a week would be delivered, with a goal of 250 million doses by the end of flu season in March or April.

&quot;Not only did we complete our commitment to provide seasonal vaccine ahead of schedule, we are making every effort to make as much H1N1 vaccine available as quickly as possible,&quot; Novartis vaccines chief Andrin Oswald said in a statement.

GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) Chief Executive Andrew Witty said on Wednesday his company had initially experienced problems, but yields were now improving and he predicted the final yield would be &quot;pretty good&quot; compared with historic flu strains. [ID:nLS37924]

Glaxo is one of the world&apos;s largest manufacturers of flu vaccines, along with Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) and Novartis. It is not, however, a big source of vaccine for the U.S., since it is still awaiting approval for its unadjuvanted vaccine from U.S. regulators.

Sanofi has said it is on track to deliver more than 75 million doses to the United States.

LOW YIELDS

Novartis said production was progressing despite low yields of the initial seed virus. It will produce 90 million units of bulk antigen, which is expected to result in 60 million finished vaccine doses, due in part to overfills in the filling process. It has already shipped more than 7.5 million doses and expects to reach 25 to 30 million by the end of November, in line with commitments it made to U.S. authorities. To date, 42 million bulk units of vaccine have been produced and the full run of 90 million is expected to be completed by December.

As requested, Novartis is supplying the U.S. with unadjuvanted vaccine, which does not contain an additive. But it is has also started delivering its own adjuvant, which could be used with the vaccine to double the number of doses produced.

AstraZeneca&apos;s Chief Financial Officer Simon Lowth said it had already delivered 10 million doses of H1N1 vaccine to the U.S. and was on track for a total of 40 million by early 2010.

Unlike other vaccine firms, AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune unit supplies flu vaccine as a nasal spray rather than injection and uses a different system to make the vaccine.

It has not had problems with vaccine yields but is constrained by the number of spraying devices that can be manufactured.

MedImmune, which could produce about 200 million doses of its needle-free vaccine in bulk, is now talking to regulators about perfecting a dropper device to drip vaccines into the nose -- technology that has been used with other vaccines.

In early afternoon trade Novartis shares were down 0.37 percent, Sanofi-Aventis down 1.73 percent, Glaxo down 0.72 percent, and Astrazeneca down 1.76 percent. (Editing by John Stonestreet/Will Waterman)</body>

It has already shipped more than 7.5 million doses and expects to reach 25 to 30 million by the end of November, in line with commitments it made to U.S. authorities. To date, 42 million bulk units of vaccine have been produced and the full run of 90 million is expected to be completed by December.

As requested, Novartis is supplying the U.S. with unadjuvanted vaccine, which does not contain an additive. But it is has also started delivering its own adjuvant, which could be used with the vaccine to double the number of doses produced.

AstraZeneca&apos;s Chief Financial Officer Simon Lowth said it had already delivered 10 million doses of H1N1 vaccine to the U.S. and was on track for a total of 40 million by early 2010.

Unlike other vaccine firms, AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune unit supplies flu vaccine as a nasal spray rather than injection and uses a different system to make the vaccine.

It has not had problems with vaccine yields but is constrained by the number of spraying devices that can be manufactured.

MedImmune, which could produce about 200 million doses of its needle-free vaccine in bulk, is now talking to regulators about perfecting a dropper device to drip vaccines into the nose -- technology that has been used with other vaccines.

In early afternoon trade Novartis shares were down 0.37 percent, Sanofi-Aventis down 1.73 percent, Glaxo down 0.72 percent, and Astra Zeneca down 1.76 percent.

By Ben Hirschler

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) increased its full-year outlook for the second quarter in a row on Thursday as earnings jumped 28 percent, beating forecasts, helped by earlier-than-expected revenues from its swine flu vaccine.

But the one-off nature of the gain from flu and other factors diluted the strong results, and investors fretted over prospects for new blood thinner Brilinta, pushing shares in the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker lower.

AstraZeneca has been helped this year by the resilience of the pharmaceutical sales and delays in cheap generic versions of heart drug Toprol XL and cancer treatment Casodex -- though both have now been launched in the United States.

The sale of H1N1 swine flu vaccine to the U.S. government by the group&apos;s MedImmune unit has been an added bonus, contributing $152 million to sales in the third quarter -- a lot more than the nominal $25 million or so many analysts had forecast.

&quot;Overall, the business has performed more strongly on the top line than we had anticipated and we haven&apos;t experienced quite the extent of the headwind that we had anticipated at the beginning of the year,&quot; said finance chief Simon Lowth.

Long-term concerns remain, however, given the threat of generic competition to AstraZeneca&apos;s top-selling medicines such as heartburn drug Nexium, Seroquel for schizophrenia and, further off, cholesterol drug Crestor.

Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Baum said the outlook for the company &quot;gets much tougher from here&quot;.

Lowth acknowledged one-offs had helped in the quarter but said key drivers, including Crestor, were doing well.

&quot;Even if we strip out a couple of the unanticipated upsides ... such as Toprol and H1N1 ... we&apos;ve still maintained strong growth of the business of 5 percent or so,&quot; he told reporters.

AstraZeneca&apos;s core pretax profit rose 28 percent to $3.4 billion in the third quarter, equivalent to core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.68, on sales up 5 percent at $8.2 billion.

The mean consensus forecast had been for core earnings, which exclude certain restructuring costs and charges, of $1.38 and sales of $7.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

AstraZeneca now predicts full-year EPS of $6.20-6.40 versus $5.70-6.00 previously forecast.

NOT SO BRILLIANT?

AstraZeneca has seen an improvement in its pipeline prospects this year -- but things are not going all its way.

On Wednesday, it pulled regulatory submissions for its experimental lung cancer drug Zactima and on Thursday investors were unnerved by suggestions its key experimental heart drug Brilinta did not work so well when patients also got a high dose of aspirin. [ID:nLS626291] [ID:nLT340442]

The firm also said it had reached an agreement in principle with U.S. attorney&apos;s office in Philadelphia to resolve an investigation related to its schizophrenia drug Seroquel sales and marketing practices.

The settlement accounts for $520 million of the $538 million provisions taken in the first nine months of the year, it said.

Other major drugmakers in Europe and the United States have also reported solid results this quarter, helped by an industry-wide cost-cutting drive that has softened the impact of generic competition to many products.

Those companies with vaccine capacity also stand to book exceptional profits from the sale of H1N1 swine flu vaccine in the fourth quarter, as highlighted by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) on Wednesday. [ID:nLR454208]

Swine flu will also be a focus when Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), the world&apos;s biggest flu vaccine manufacturer, wraps up the Big Pharma reporting season on Friday.

AstraZeneca is a relatively small player in the flu market but it has a $453 million contract with the U.S. government to supply around 40 million doses of a nasal spray form of H1N1 vaccine.

Shares in AstraZeneca, which were off 1.4 percent by 1515 GMT, underperforming a 0.6 percent decline in the European drugs sector .SXDP, trade at around 7.7 times forecast 2010 earnings, a discount to British-based rival Glaxo, reflecting concerns about upcoming generic competition.

* Two well-publicized deaths fuel public concern (Adds statement from Health Canada)

TORONTO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Canadian officials warned on Thursday that vaccines for the H1N1 virus would likely be in short supply, as thousands of people across the country lined up to get swine flu shots.

Within about half an hour of clinics opening for high-risk patients in Toronto, officials started turning people away and warning those in line that they might have to wait six or seven hours.

Later in the day, Health Canada said vaccine supplies would get even tighter next week.

Shipments to the provinces and territories would slow because the supplier, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), had temporarily shifted production to a type of vaccine recommended for pregnant women, the federal government agency said in a statement.

That will reduce supplies of a more powerful version suitable for the general population next week, the ministry said, although the flow is expected to pick up afterward.

&quot;We continue to work with both GSK and provinces and territories to ensure all Canadians who want to be vaccinated will be immunized by Christmas,&quot; it said.

The statement came after the western province of Manitoba said the federal government had warned the provinces that &quot;significantly less vaccine&quot; than expected would be delivered.

&quot;Regional health authorities may have to adjust their clinic schedules, including postponing clinic dates, until there is sufficient vaccine supply,&quot; health authorities in Manitoba said.

In Toronto, Canada&apos;s largest city, public health spokeswoman Rishma Govani said public sentiment on the H1N1 virus had swung from complacency to concern after news a teenager and a young girl had died from the H1N1 virus.

&quot;The whole outlook changed within days and escalated and expanded,&quot; Govani said, noting Toronto had moved up its plans for opening clinics to the public by several days.

&quot;People just got scared or panicked.&quot;

She said the city&apos;s public health officials wanted people to get vaccinated when possible, but the effect of swine flu was usually mild unless there were pre-existing medical conditions.

Two high-profile cases in the province of Ontario rang alarm bells with the public. A 10-year-old girl with no previous medical problems died from the flu in eastern Ontario and a teenage hockey player died in Toronto.

&quot;The medical experts are emphasizing that those examples are exceptions,&quot; Govani said.

At the East York Civic Centre in Toronto&apos;s east end, Meegan Loudon had already waited four hours with two children, aged 4 and 7, and she was still far from the front of the line.

&quot;The feeling isn&apos;t one of overwhelming frustration,&quot; Loudon said. &quot;It feels like everyone here is trying to do the best they can.&quot;

The Canadian government has ordered enough vaccines for everyone in Canada, which has a population of more than 33 million. Vaccinations began this week for children, the elderly and other high-risk groups, with clinics ramping up in increasing numbers next week.

    <body>By Roberta Rampton and Lucy Hornby

WASHINGTON/HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - China pledged to lift its ban on U.S. pork on Thursday and the United States took a step toward easing restrictions on chicken imports as the two superpowers agreed to tackle a series of trade irritants.

The flurry of trade accords between China and America comes ahead of President Barack Obama&apos;s visit to China in mid-November to reach agreements on currency, the environment and trade with its second-largest trading partner and the largest foreign holder of its government debt.

China&apos;s promise on pork sent U.S. hog futures higher on Thursday and also lifted the stock of Smithfield Foods Inc, the largest U.S. hog and pork producer.

&quot;We&apos;re going to work through whatever details remain to try to get this done as expeditiously as possible,&quot; U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Reuters during a telephone interview from Hangzhou, where the countries held trade talks.

China is a top buyer of U.S. meat, chicken, soybeans and other products, purchasing $560 million worth of pork in 2008. China imposed the ban on U.S. pork five months ago following the outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus, also known as swine flu. The disease cannot be caught by eating pork.

China&apos;s Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai did not say when he would announce a formal end to the pork ban.

&quot;He didn&apos;t put a specific timeline on it, but as you know President Obama is coming to China in a couple of weeks, and I don&apos;t know whether that is part of their calculation or not,&quot; Vilsack said.

China&apos;s willingness to lift its pork ban was not related to the recent move by Congress to end its ban on imports of Chinese poultry products, Vilsack said.

&quot;I asked Minister Sun that specific question, and he was very emphatic in indicating that there&apos;s no connection,&quot; he said.

But Vilsack said his department will soon begin the process to review China&apos;s food safety laws and poultry plants with an eye to allowing U.S. imports of poultry meat.

Vilsack said officials did not discuss China&apos;s recent anti-dumping investigation into U.S. chicken exports.

News that China would scrap the ban sent U.S. hog futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange up 2 percent early Thursday. Hog futures have fallen about 40 percent after hitting a high of 90 cents per lb in August 2008 amid high prices for feedstock, the recession blunting demand and the H1N1 flu.

Shares of Smithfield Foods Inc rose as much as 5 percent to $13.92 per share Thursday morning at the New York Stock Exchange.

BEEF ISSUES REMAIN

While making progress on pork and chicken, China and the United States are still at odds over beef.

China has banned U.S. beef imports since the United States found its first case of mad cow disease in 2003.

&quot;I think there&apos;s still work to be done&quot; on the beef issue, Vilsack said, noting talks focused on pork and poultry trade.

&quot;I think we have to be creative. I think we have to put something on the table (on beef trade) for the Chinese to respond to, and we intend to do that very quickly,&quot; he said.

Vilsack said he had established &quot;a good personal chemistry&quot; with Sun during the talks.

&quot;We&apos;re going to try to build on the momentum that was created during this meeting&quot; to focus on other outstanding farm trade issues, he said.

    <body>Oct 29 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- Ottawa will have to lead a massive restructuring of the Canadian economy, with wealth flowing from the West to the rest of the country, if it is to meet its climate-change targets, a landmark report has concluded.

- Flu clinics across the country are facing the prospect of a shortage of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine over the next couple of weeks as Canadians heed the advice of public health officials and line up to get inoculated.

A second wave of the virus, which has killed two children in recent days, has prompted Canadians to queue for hours at flu clinics.

BUSINESS:

- Hydro-Quebec is pushing to gain control of more of Eastern Canada&apos;s power grid.

Quebec Premier Jean Charest and his New Brunswick counterpart Shawn Graham are expected to announce in Fredericton on Thursday that North America&apos;s biggest hydroelectric company is taking over New Brunswick Power Group.

- It was almost certainly the furthest thing from his mind, but Norges Bank Governor Svein Gjedrem&apos;s decision to become the first European central banker to raise interest rates after the financial crisis will help Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney&apos;s efforts to restrain the ascent of the dollar.

NATIONAL POST:

- A young army officer became the first Canadian killed in action since a new rotation of troops flowed into this war-torn province earlier this month.

Lt. Justin Garrett Boyes, 26, of Saskatchewan, was killed Wednesday by a homemade bomb planted while on a morning foot patrol with Afghan National Police about 20 kilometres southwest of Kandahar City.

- Toronto Public Health confirmed on Wednesday an H1N1 flu outbreak at Mount Sinai hospital.

While speaking to reporters in a conference room at Toronto Public Health&apos;s downtown office, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, director of communicable disease control, confirmed the outbreak.

FINANCIAL POST:

After an almost uninterrupted six-month rally that saw stocks climb 60 percent, a host of technical indicators are lining up to suggest there could be more downside to come.

- The Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level in just over three weeks Wednesday as investors shunned currencies considered risky in favour of the U.S. dollar and oil prices fell on doubt over economic recovery.

The dour mood sent the Canadian currency as low as C$1.0804 to the U.S. dollar, or 92.56 U.S. cents, its lowest level since early October.</body>

    <body>* Q3 EPS ex items of 69 cents vs 66-cent Wall St view

* Reserves for paying claims sees as positive sign

* Shares rise 7 percent (Recasts, adds analyst, CFO comments)

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) posted an 18 percent increase in third-quarter net income on better returns from its investments and gave indications it had a firm grip on medical cost problems that plagued the company earlier this year.

Shares of the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, which have underperformed those of rivals this year, rose 7 percent as its quarterly profit also topped analyst expectations.

Even as Aetna projected a weak fourth-quarter hit by high flu-related medical costs, Aetna&apos;s level of reserves to pay claims left investors more confident about its outlook.

&quot;They took a leap forward in improving sentiment on the quality of the company&apos;s outlook and their balance sheet and I think that&apos;s critical for the stock,&quot; said David Heupel, a portfolio manager with Thrivent Investment Management.

&quot;We&apos;ve been concerned about their reserve levels and they moved in the right direction in this quarter.&quot;

Aetna called 2010 a &quot;repositioning year,&quot; although it deferred giving a specific forecast until early next year. It expects to shed as many as 650,000 members in the first quarter as it takes actions to strengthen its pricing.

&quot;Given the fact they&apos;re able to get ahead of this rising cost trend and be more conservative in pricing for 2010 it should enable earnings to stabilize and even potentially expand in 2010,&quot; Edward Jones analyst Steve Shubitz said.

Third-quarter net income rose to $326.2 million, or 73 cents per share, from $277.3 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier, when Aetna realized huge investment losses stemming from the credit crisis.

Excluding items, earnings of 69 cents per share were 3 cents ahead of the analysts&apos; average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 14 percent to $8.72 billion.

Aetna follows large insurers WellPoint (WLP.N) and UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) in posting a better-than-expected third-quarter profit.

But shares of U.S. health insurers are trading at rock-bottom valuations over concerns a health system overhaul under debate in Congress will dramatically undercut their business.

Aetna&apos;s enrollment stood at 19.03 million at the end of September, up 8 percent from a year earlier, but down slightly from the end of June.

In its commercial plans serving employers, the company spent 85.6 percent of its premium revenue on medical costs, compared with 80.3 percent a year earlier. Aetna had targeted a range of 84 percent to 85 percent for the second half of 2009.

Aetna saw high costs from the H1N1 flu and Cobra insurance for Americans who lost their jobs. WellPoint cited those factors on Wednesday in projecting higher medical expenses for the year.

But in a positive sign for Aetna, it reported about $30 million was left over from prior periods after being set aside to pay claims, indicating a conservative reserve position.

&quot;We certainly believe we understand the new view of medical cost trend and are pricing to it appropriately,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Joseph Zubretsky said in an interview. &quot;That is the essence of this business.&quot;

Aetna forecast full-year operating earnings of $2.75 per share. In July, it forecast a range of $2.75 to $2.90. Analysts looked for $2.86.

The new profit forecast represents a reduction of as much as 30 percent from the initial 2009 forecast for Aetna, which had already lowered its outlook twice during the year.

Aetna shares rose $1.76 to $27.08 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Wednesday, Aetna shares had fallen 11 percent this year, making it the worst performer among large health insurance stocks. (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Derek Caney)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Patients taking statin drugs were almost 50 percent less likely to die from flu, researchers reported on Thursday in a study providing more evidence the cholesterol-lowering drugs help the body cope with infection.

The findings are compelling enough to justify doing controlled studies in which some patients are given the drugs deliberately and some are not, said Meredith Vandermeer of the Oregon Public Health Division, who helped lead the study.

&quot;Our preliminary study shows these cholesterol-lowering medications called statins are associated with a decrease in mortality,&quot; Vandermeer told a news conference at a meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

&quot;This early research suggests there may be a role for statins in influenza treatment and it should be studied further.&quot;

Vandermeer and a team of researchers, including at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at the records of 2,800 people who were hospitalized with seasonal influenza in 10 states during the 2007-2008 flu season.

A new strain called H1N1 swine flu is causing a pandemic now but seasonal influenza puts an estimated 200,000 Americans into the hospital every year and kills 36,000. Antiviral drugs can help save their lives but only if given quickly and doctors are searching for other ways to help patients.

Of the patients studied, 801 were taking statins anyway and continued taking them while hospitalized. Seventeen patients who were taking statins died while in the hospital or within a month afterward, compared to 64 who were not taking statins, Vandermeer said.

Overall, 2.1 percent of patients taking statins died, compared to 3.2 percent of patients not taking statins. That means patients taking statins were just under 50 percent less likely to die.

The researchers had to exclude patients who were on mechanical ventilators and unable to take their prescribed statins so the study does not include those cases, Vandermeer said.

Her team is now doing an analysis to find out if one brand of statin is more effective than another.

A few other studies also have suggested that statins may help flu patients by lowering inflammation.

Inflammation is part of the body&apos;s immune response -- a flood of chemicals and cells summoned to fight viral and bacterial invaders. It is also involved in heart and artery disease.

Some flu patients develop a quick and overwhelming inflammatory response to infection and sometimes this can kill them. Doctors are trying to understand why and to find ways to battle this overreaction.

Statin drugs include AstraZeneca&apos;s Crestor, known generically as rosuvastatin, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pravachol or pravastatin and Merck&apos;s Mevacor, or lovastatin.

By Roberta Rampton and Lucy Hornby

WASHINGTON/HANGZHOU, China, Oct 29 (Reuters) - China pledged to lift its ban on U.S. pork on Thursday and the United States took a step toward easing restrictions on chicken imports as the two superpowers agreed to tackle a series of trade irritants.

The flurry of trade accords between China and America comes ahead of President Barack Obama&apos;s visit to China in mid-November to reach agreements on currency, the environment and trade with its second-largest trading partner and the largest foreign holder of its government debt. [ID:nPEK8692]

China&apos;s promise on pork sent U.S. hog futures higher on Thursday and also lifted the stock of Smithfield Foods Inc (SFD.N), the largest U.S. hog and pork producer.

&quot;We&apos;re going to work through whatever details remain to try to get this done as expeditiously as possible,&quot; U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Reuters during a telephone interview from Hangzhou, where the countries held trade talks. [ID:nN29356378]

China is a top buyer of U.S. meat, chicken, soybeans and other products, purchasing $560 million worth of pork in 2008. China imposed the ban on U.S. pork five months ago following the outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus, also known as swine flu. The disease cannot be caught by eating pork.

China&apos;s Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai did not say when he would announce a formal end to the pork ban.

&quot;He didn&apos;t put a specific timeline on it, but as you know President Obama is coming to China in a couple of weeks, and I don&apos;t know whether that is part of their calculation or not,&quot; Vilsack said.

China&apos;s willingness to lift its pork ban was not related to the recent move by Congress to end its ban on imports of Chinese poultry products, Vilsack said.

&quot;I asked Minister Sun that specific question, and he was very emphatic in indicating that there&apos;s no connection,&quot; he said.

But Vilsack said his department will soon begin the process to review China&apos;s food safety laws and poultry plants with an eye to allowing U.S. imports of poultry meat.

Vilsack said officials did not discuss China&apos;s recent anti-dumping investigation into U.S. chicken exports. [ID:nPEK218176]

News that China would scrap the ban sent U.S. hog futures &lt;0#LH:&gt; at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange up 2 percent early Thursday. Hog futures have fallen about 40 percent after hitting a high of 90 cents per lb in August 2008 amid high prices for feedstock, the recession blunting demand and the H1N1 flu.

Shares of Smithfield Foods Inc rose as much as 5 percent to $13.92 per share Thursday morning at the New York Stock Exchange.

BEEF ISSUES REMAIN

While making progress on pork and chicken, China and the United States are still at odds over beef.

China has banned U.S. beef imports since the United States found its first case of mad cow disease in 2003.

&quot;I think there&apos;s still work to be done&quot; on the beef issue, Vilsack said, noting talks focused on pork and poultry trade.

&quot;I think we have to be creative. I think we have to put something on the table (on beef trade) for the Chinese to respond to, and we intend to do that very quickly,&quot; he said.

Vilsack said he had established &quot;a good personal chemistry&quot; with Sun during the talks.

&quot;We&apos;re going to try to build on the momentum that was created during this meeting&quot; to focus on other outstanding farm trade issues, he said. (Additional reporting by Bob Burgdorfer in Chicago; Writing by Lisa Shumaker; Editing by Russ Blinch)</body>

    <body>Oct 29 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- Ottawa will have to lead a massive restructuring of the Canadian economy, with wealth flowing from the West to the rest of the country, if it is to meet its climate-change targets, a landmark report has concluded.

- Flu clinics across the country are facing the prospect of a shortage of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine over the next couple of weeks as Canadians heed the advice of public health officials and line up to get inoculated.

A second wave of the virus, which has killed two children in recent days, has prompted Canadians to queue for hours at flu clinics.

BUSINESS:

- Hydro-Quebec is pushing to gain control of more of Eastern Canada&apos;s power grid.

Quebec Premier Jean Charest and his New Brunswick counterpart Shawn Graham are expected to announce in Fredericton on Thursday that North America&apos;s biggest hydroelectric company is taking over New Brunswick Power Group.

- It was almost certainly the furthest thing from his mind, but Norges Bank Governor Svein Gjedrem&apos;s decision to become the first European central banker to raise interest rates after the financial crisis will help Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney&apos;s efforts to restrain the ascent of the dollar.

NATIONAL POST:

- A young army officer became the first Canadian killed in action since a new rotation of troops flowed into this war-torn province earlier this month.

Lt. Justin Garrett Boyes, 26, of Saskatchewan, was killed Wednesday by a homemade bomb planted while on a morning foot patrol with Afghan National Police about 20 kilometres southwest of Kandahar City.

- Toronto Public Health confirmed on Wednesday an H1N1 flu outbreak at Mount Sinai hospital.

While speaking to reporters in a conference room at Toronto Public Health&apos;s downtown office, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, director of communicable disease control, confirmed the outbreak.

FINANCIAL POST:

After an almost uninterrupted six-month rally that saw stocks climb 60 percent, a host of technical indicators are lining up to suggest there could be more downside to come.

- The Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level in just over three weeks Wednesday as investors shunned currencies considered risky in favour of the U.S. dollar and oil prices fell on doubt over economic recovery.

The dour mood sent the Canadian currency as low as C$1.0804 to the U.S. dollar, or 92.56 U.S. cents, its lowest level since early October.</body>

By Lucy Hornby

HANGZHOU, China, Oct 29 (Reuters) - China and the United States agreed to tackle a series of trade irritants and reiterated pledges against protectionism, but left the broader questions of the value of Chinese currency and U.S. debt untouched at high-level talks that ended on Thursday.

In a sign that the global financial crisis has fuelled a risk of more, not fewer, trade barriers, Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming confirmed that Beijing would conduct a preliminary dumping investigation of U.S. auto imports.

The probe was initially announced in response to the imposition last month by the United States of tariffs on Chinese tyres, the first time the U.S. invoked safeguard clause China agreed to when it joined the World Trade Organisation.

Speaking to reporters after the bilateral meetings, officials from both countries tried to keep the focus on areas of agreement, not contention.

Importantly for U.S. businesses, China agreed to treat products of U.S.-China joint ventures as local products in government procurement tenders, and would submit a revised offer to join the World Trade Organisation&apos;s government procurement agreement by 2010, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said.

China will remove its local content requirement in tenders for wind power equipment, Zhang Guobao, head of the National Energy Administration, said.

The United States, for its part, agreed that imposing curbs on imports from China was not the way to tackle the country&apos;s politically contentious trade surplus, Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said.

&quot;The two have agreed that the solution to the trade gap between the United States and China is not to restrict imports from China but to promote balance,&quot; Chen told reporters through an interpreter.

China will soon allow imports of U.S. pork, after a ban following the outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus, also known as swine flu, Chinese Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai and his U.S. counterpart, Tom Vilsack, said.

The U.S. Congress had earlier dropped its ban on U.S. agencies certifying Chinese cooked poultry for U.S. sales.

&quot;I hope pork imports can quickly resume, but I also hope the the U.S. will follow Chinese requirements to credibly ensure the quality, safety and health of pork exports to China,&quot; Sun said, adding China had already restored cooked pork products imports.

They did not give a timeframe for the ban to be lifted.

OBAMA&apos;S VISIT

President Barack Obama will travel to China in mid-November, preceded by a flurry of official American visits as the United States tries to reach accords on currency, the environment and trade with its second-largest trading partner and the largest foreign holder of its government debt.

For a FACTBOX on the two countries&apos; interdependency, please click on [ID:nPEK294728].

Chen said the United States agreed to establish a working group to examine Beijing&apos;s long-standing demand that Washington formally regard it as a market economy, a status that would make it harder to impose trade penalties on China.

As part of its WTO agreement, China gets that status automatically in 2016, but is pushing for earlier recognition in light of its market reforms.

Chen said progress on U.S. recognition was unrelated to &quot;micro-economic&quot; issues such as U.S. concerns that China subsidises its state-owned enterprises with cheap loans, land and other resources.

The U.S. failed to get China to retreat on regulations over online music distribution, but officials said they were pleased with Chinese pledges to combat and punish Internet piracy.

Intellectual property rights are one of the biggest concerns of U.S. investors in China, where piracy of brand name clothing, films, books, music, and industrial patents is rampant.

The Obama administration angered China, whose economy is heavily dependent on exports, when it slapped a 35 percent safeguard duty on imports of Chinese-made tyres, which totaled about $1.8 billion last year.

China immediately challenged the action at the World Trade Organisation and said it would launch an anti-dumping and countervailing-duty investigation against U.S. poultry and autos to offset unfair pricing and government subsidies.

The probe into U.S. auto imports would be &quot;objective, just and fair,&quot; Chen said. (Editing by Nick Macfie)</body>

WASHINGTON/HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - China pledged to lift its ban on U.S. pork on Thursday and the United States took a step toward easing restrictions on chicken imports as the two superpowers agreed to tackle a series of trade irritants.

The flurry of trade accords between China and America comes ahead of President Barack Obama&apos;s visit to China in mid-November to reach agreements on currency, the environment and trade with its second-largest trading partner and the largest foreign holder of its government debt.

China&apos;s promise on pork sent U.S. hog futures higher on Thursday and also lifted the stock of Smithfield Foods Inc, the largest U.S. hog and pork producer.

&quot;We&apos;re going to work through whatever details remain to try to get this done as expeditiously as possible,&quot; U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Reuters during a telephone interview from Hangzhou, where the countries held trade talks.

China is a top buyer of U.S. meat, chicken, soybeans and other products, purchasing $560 million worth of pork in 2008. China imposed the ban on U.S. pork five months ago following the outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus, also known as swine flu. The disease cannot be caught by eating pork.

China&apos;s Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai did not say when he would announce a formal end to the pork ban.

&quot;He didn&apos;t put a specific timeline on it, but as you know President Obama is coming to China in a couple of weeks, and I don&apos;t know whether that is part of their calculation or not,&quot; Vilsack said.

China&apos;s willingness to lift its pork ban was not related to the recent move by Congress to end its ban on imports of Chinese poultry products, Vilsack said.

&quot;I asked Minister Sun that specific question, and he was very emphatic in indicating that there&apos;s no connection,&quot; he said.

But Vilsack said his department will soon begin the process to review China&apos;s food safety laws and poultry plants with an eye to allowing U.S. imports of poultry meat.

Vilsack said officials did not discuss China&apos;s recent anti-dumping investigation into U.S. chicken exports.

News that China would scrap the ban sent U.S. hog futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange up 2 percent early Thursday. Hog futures have fallen about 40 percent after hitting a high of 90 cents per lb in August 2008 amid high prices for feedstock, the recession blunting demand and the H1N1 flu.

Shares of Smithfield Foods Inc rose as much as 5 percent to $13.92 per share Thursday morning at the New York Stock Exchange.

BEEF ISSUES REMAIN

While making progress on pork and chicken, China and the United States are still at odds over beef.

China has banned U.S. beef imports since the United States found its first case of mad cow disease in 2003.

&quot;I think there&apos;s still work to be done&quot; on the beef issue, Vilsack said, noting talks focused on pork and poultry trade.

&quot;I think we have to be creative. I think we have to put something on the table (on beef trade) for the Chinese to respond to, and we intend to do that very quickly,&quot; he said.

Vilsack said he had established &quot;a good personal chemistry&quot; with Sun during the talks.

&quot;We&apos;re going to try to build on the momentum that was created during this meeting&quot; to focus on other outstanding farm trade issues, he said.

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) posted an 18 percent increase in third-quarter net income on better returns from its investments and gave indications it had a firm grip on medical cost problems that plagued the company earlier this year.

Shares of the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, which have underperformed those of rivals this year, rose 7 percent as its quarterly profit also topped analyst expectations.

Even as Aetna projected a weak fourth-quarter hit by high flu-related medical costs, Aetna&apos;s level of reserves to pay claims left investors more confident about its outlook.

&quot;They took a leap forward in improving sentiment on the quality of the company&apos;s outlook and their balance sheet and I think that&apos;s critical for the stock,&quot; said David Heupel, a portfolio manager with Thrivent Investment Management.

&quot;We&apos;ve been concerned about their reserve levels and they moved in the right direction in this quarter.&quot;

Aetna called 2010 a &quot;repositioning year,&quot; although it deferred giving a specific forecast until early next year. It expects to shed as many as 650,000 members in the first quarter as it takes actions to strengthen its pricing.

&quot;Given the fact they&apos;re able to get ahead of this rising cost trend and be more conservative in pricing for 2010 it should enable earnings to stabilize and even potentially expand in 2010,&quot; Edward Jones analyst Steve Shubitz said.

Third-quarter net income rose to $326.2 million, or 73 cents per share, from $277.3 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier, when Aetna realized huge investment losses stemming from the credit crisis.

Excluding items, earnings of 69 cents per share were 3 cents ahead of the analysts&apos; average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 14 percent to $8.72 billion.

Aetna follows large insurers WellPoint (WLP.N) and UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) in posting a better-than-expected third-quarter profit.

But shares of U.S. health insurers are trading at rock-bottom valuations over concerns a health system overhaul under debate in Congress will dramatically undercut their business.

Aetna&apos;s enrollment stood at 19.03 million at the end of September, up 8 percent from a year earlier, but down slightly from the end of June.

In its commercial plans serving employers, the company spent 85.6 percent of its premium revenue on medical costs, compared with 80.3 percent a year earlier. Aetna had targeted a range of 84 percent to 85 percent for the second half of 2009.

Aetna saw high costs from the H1N1 flu and Cobra insurance for Americans who lost their jobs. WellPoint cited those factors on Wednesday in projecting higher medical expenses for the year.

But in a positive sign for Aetna, it reported about $30 million was left over from prior periods after being set aside to pay claims, indicating a conservative reserve position.

&quot;We certainly believe we understand the new view of medical cost trend and are pricing to it appropriately,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Joseph Zubretsky said in an interview. &quot;That is the essence of this business.&quot;

Aetna forecast full-year operating earnings of $2.75 per share. In July, it forecast a range of $2.75 to $2.90. Analysts looked for $2.86.

The new profit forecast represents a reduction of as much as 30 percent from the initial 2009 forecast for Aetna, which had already lowered its outlook twice during the year.

Aetna shares rose $1.76 to $27.08 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Wednesday, Aetna shares had fallen 11 percent this year, making it the worst performer among large health insurance stocks. (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Derek Caney)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Patients taking statin drugs were almost 50 percent less likely to die from flu, researchers reported on Thursday in a study providing more evidence the cholesterol-lowering drugs help the body cope with infection.

The findings are compelling enough to justify doing controlled studies in which some patients are given the drugs deliberately and some are not, said Meredith Vandermeer of the Oregon Public Health Division, who helped lead the study.

&quot;Our preliminary study shows these cholesterol-lowering medications called statins are associated with a decrease in mortality,&quot; Vandermeer told a news conference at a meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

&quot;This early research suggests there may be a role for statins in influenza treatment and it should be studied further.&quot;

Vandermeer and a team of researchers, including at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at the records of 2,800 people who were hospitalized with seasonal influenza in 10 states during the 2007-2008 flu season.

A new strain called H1N1 swine flu is causing a pandemic now but seasonal influenza puts an estimated 200,000 Americans into the hospital every year and kills 36,000. Antiviral drugs can help save their lives but only if given quickly and doctors are searching for other ways to help patients.

Of the patients studied, 801 were taking statins anyway and continued taking them while hospitalized. Seventeen patients who were taking statins died while in the hospital or within a month afterward, compared to 64 who were not taking statins, Vandermeer said.

Overall, 2.1 percent of patients taking statins died, compared to 3.2 percent of patients not taking statins. That means patients taking statins were just under 50 percent less likely to die.

The researchers had to exclude patients who were on mechanical ventilators and unable to take their prescribed statins so the study does not include those cases, Vandermeer said.

Her team is now doing an analysis to find out if one brand of statin is more effective than another.

A few other studies also have suggested that statins may help flu patients by lowering inflammation.

Inflammation is part of the body&apos;s immune response -- a flood of chemicals and cells summoned to fight viral and bacterial invaders. It is also involved in heart and artery disease.

Some flu patients develop a quick and overwhelming inflammatory response to infection and sometimes this can kill them. Doctors are trying to understand why and to find ways to battle this overreaction.

Statin drugs include AstraZeneca&apos;s Crestor, known generically as rosuvastatin, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pravachol or pravastatin and Merck&apos;s Mevacor, or lovastatin.

    <body>* Fourth week with double-digit lead

* Pollster says popular support not a blip

* Liberals lost ground after trying for early election

OTTAWA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Canada&apos;s governing Conservatives are maintaining a strong lead in public support following an ill-fated attempt by the opposition Liberals to force an early election, an Ekos poll issued on Thursday said.

&quot;This is not a blip,&quot; Ekos President Frank Graves said in a statement, noting that it was the fourth straight week in which the Conservatives are showing a double-digit lead.

&quot;The Tories streaked into their current lead when the Liberals started threatening an early election in (September),&quot; Graves said. &quot;However, they are now standing up despite negative news reports about the distribution of stimulus money and the confusion around the H1N1 vaccination program.&quot;

The Conservative lead widened slightly to 11.6 points from 11.2 points in an Ekos poll a week earlier. But it was down from the 15-point edge they had two weeks ago.

Graves said the data does not mean the Conservatives cannot be knocked off their pedestal. &quot;However, it does mean the other parties have their work cut out for them.&quot;

The latest Ekos poll put the Conservatives at 38.4 percent support, the Liberals at 26.8 percent, the left-leaning New Democrats at 16.7 percent, the Greens at 9.9 percent, and the separatist Bloc Quebecois at 8.2 percent.

The Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, were reelected a year ago with a strengthened minority of seats in the House of Commons, meaning they require at least one party&apos;s cooperation to stay in power.

The current results would seem likely to translate into another minority though a majority would be within reach.

The automated telephone survey of 3,220 was conducted Oct. 21-27 and carries a margin of error of 1.7 percentage points 19 times out of 20. (Reporting by Randall Palmer; editing by Peter Galloway)</body>

    <body>* BoCom falls after posting flat quarterly profit * Nine Dragons tumbles on new share sale plan (Updates to midday) By Jun Ebias and Claire Zhang HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Shares in Hong Kong
and China eased on Thursday, as weak overseas markets spurred
move profit taking, while Nine Dragons&apos; plan to sell new shares
further dampened investor sentiment toward the mainland firm. In Shanghai, China&apos;s key stock index sank 2.1 percent, with
blue-chip shares soft as more supplies hit the market, while
investors shifted some of their attention to the ChiNext start-up
market due to debut on Friday. The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI eased 2.42 percent or
525.70 points to 21,235.88 at midday. Turnover was HK$47.68
billion ($6.2 billion), versus midday Wednesday&apos;s HK$40.00
billion. &quot;Funds appear to be locking in profit as the month end
approaches,&quot; said John Mar, co-head of sales trading, Daiwa
Securities SMBC. &quot;Given that we are near the top of recent
trading ranges, market direction has been taking a lead from
overnight moves in the U.S. markets.&quot; Bank of Communications (3328.HK) (BoCom) shed 5.98 percent,
after reporting a flat quarterly net profit. [ID:nSHA292778] &quot;There wasn&apos;t much of a positive surprise in it&apos;s
third-quarter results, so it&apos;s down a bit more than the other
banks,&quot; said Paul Lee, an analyst at Tai Fook Securities. The
bank will likely post low single-digit growth in net profit for
the whole of 2009, he added. Citi reiterated its sell&apos; recommendation on BoCom, noting
that the lender has the lowest tier 1 capital ratio among its
peers, which could be a constraint on future loan growth. Index heavyweight HSBC Holdings (0005.HK) lost 1.73 percent
and Bank of China (3988.HK) was 2.70 percent lower. The China Enterprise Index of top locally listed mainland
Chinese stocks .HSCE dropped 3.08 percent to 12,436.50. PetroChina (0857.HK) fell 4.82 percent. The oil producer
posted a 23.5 percent decline in quarterly net profit as a steep
slide in crude oil prices hurt earnings. [ID:nHKF080493] Other oil firms were also down. CNOOC (0883.HK) fell 3.99
percent, while Sinopec (0386.HK) lost 1.49 percent. In Shanghai, PetroChina (601857.SS), the most heavily
weighted share in the index, fell 1.57 percent to 13.18 yuan. Nine Dragons Paper (2689.HK) tumbled 10.84 percent. The
packaging and paperboard maker said it would sell HK$2.87 billion
($370 million) worth of new shares to its controlling
shareholder. [ID:nHKG349726] Bucking the trend, Geely Automobile (0175.HK) rose 1.74
percent. Ford Motor Co (F.N) named Geely&apos;s major shareholder as
preferred bidder for its loss-making Swedish unit Volvo.
[ID:nLS682068] Zijin Mining (2899.HK) fell 4.56 percent, even after
reporting a 15.1 percent jump in quarterly profit. Lianhua Supermarket Holdings (0980.HK) lost 3.32 percent,
after reporting a 329.9 million yuan net profit in
January-September, without giving comparative figures. Wynn Macau (1128.HK) extended its decline and slid 3.62
percent. The stock ended 7.03 percent lower on Wednesday after
its parent, Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O), gave a downbeat outlook. SHANGHAI DROPS The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended the morning at
2,967.521 points, with losing Shanghai A shares outnumbering
gainers 754 to 132. Turnover edged up to 62 billion yuan from
Wednesday morning&apos;s 60 billion yuan. China State Construction Engineering Corp (601668.SS),
China&apos;s biggest home builder, fell 6.98 percent to 4.80 yuan and
was the most actively traded stock after saying 6 billion shares
emerged from a lock-up and became tradeable on Thursday. Investors cashed in profits on the shares, which surged when
they listed in Shanghai three months ago, analysts said. &quot;The fall on overseas markets encouraged selling, and blue
chips&apos; weakness could drag the index another 100 points lower,&quot;
said Li Wenhui, senior analyst at Huatai Securities in Nanjing. &quot;Investors are also keeping a close eye on ChiNext, to see
its impact on the main board.&quot;
 ChiNext, a Nasdaq-style second board for start-ups, is due to
begin trade in Shenzhen this Friday with an initial batch of 28
listed companies, and analysts said a strong debut performance
could divert money and attention away from the main board. Some expected the Shanghai benchmark index may initially move
lower to test support around its 125-day moving average, now at
2,930 points. Property shares were weak, with China Vanke (000002.SZ)
dropping 3.44 percent to 11.52 yuan, while Jiangxi Copper
(600362.SS) sagged 3.86 percent to 37.88 yuan as Shanghai copper
futures prices fell to one-week low. Steel shares were soft, with Wuhan Steel (600005.SS) losing
2.30 percent to 7.23 yuan. The U.S. Commerce Department said on
Tuesday it had set preliminary duties on imports of concrete
steel wire strand and steel grating from China to offset
government subsidies. [ID:nLS600052] But health-related shares were strong after Beijing reported
its first death from H1N1 flu. Shenzhen Neptunus Bioengineering
000078.SZ soared 8.20 percent to 16.62 yuan. (Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)</body>

 (Updates to close) By Jun Ebias and Claire Zhang
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Shares in Hong Kong
and China finished at multi-week lows on Thursday, with Chinese
banks hit by worries about a possible interest rate rise in the
mainland, while Nine Dragons Paper (2689.HK) slumped on its plan
to issue new shares. China&apos;s key stock index dropped 2.34 percent, weighed down by
banking stocks amid worries over a possible exit from the
government&apos;s loose monetary policy after Norway&apos;s interest rate
increase. The benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI slid 2.28 percent or
496.59 points to 21,264.99, its lowest in more than three weeks.
Turnover rose to HK$80.81 billion ($10.4 billion), the highest
since Sept. 17 and up from Wednesday&apos;s HK$68.97 billion. &quot;Funds appear to be locking in profit as the month&apos;s end
approaches,&quot; said John Mar, co-head of sales trading, Daiwa
Securities SMBC. &quot;Given that we are near the top of recent
trading ranges, market direction has been taking its lead from

[ID:nSHA292778] &quot;There wasn&apos;t much of a positive surprise in it&apos;s

reporting a 15.1 percent jump in quarterly profit. Lianhua Supermarket Holdings (0980.HK) lost 3.44 percent,
after reporting a 329.9 million yuan net profit in
January-September, without giving comparative figures. SHANGHAI FALLS The Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended at 2,960.466
points, the lowest level since Oct. 13, hit by weak global
markets and worries over a potential diversion of funds to
China&apos;s ChiNext start-up market, due for launch on Friday. ChiNext, a Nasdaq-style second board for start-ups, will
begin trading in Shenzhen with an initial batch of 28 listed
companies. Analysts said a strong debut could pull money and
attention away from the main board. The benchmark index has lost 4.7 percent this week from its
10-week closing high of 3,107.847 points climbed last Friday, as
signs that some governments are considering an exit from stimulus
schemes hurt sentiment. Losing Shanghai A shares outnumbered gainers by 759 to 134,
while turnover edged up to 117 billion yuan ($17.13 billion) from
Wednesday&apos;s 114 billion yuan. Banks, whose earnings performance is sensitive to monetary
policy changes, fell. Top lender Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (601398.SS) declined 2.17 percent to 4.95 yuan and was
one of the most actively traded stocks. &quot;There is mounting pressure from worries over monetary
tightening, with weak overseas markets and ChiNext&apos;s trading
debut also playing a role,&quot; said Zheng Weigang, head of
investment at Shanghai Securities. The index may have more room to fall but could find
short-term support at the key 125-day moving average, now at
2,930 points, Zheng said. After a string of upbeat economic data released in
mid-October, including GDP growth of 8.9 percent in the third
quarter, Chinese officials are now saying economic expansion is
likely to hasten this quarter. China State Construction Engineering Corp (601668.SS), the
country&apos;s biggest home builder, fell 7.17 percent to 4.79 yuan.
It was the most actively traded stock, as 6 billion shares
emerged from a lock-up and became tradeable on Thursday. Investors cashed in profits on the shares, which surged when
they were listed in Shanghai three months ago, analysts said. Health-related shares rose after Beijing reported its first
death from H1N1 flu. Shenzhen Neptunus Bioengineering 000078.SZ
advanced by its 10 percent daily limit to 16.90 yuan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government may end up throwing away unused doses of swine flu vaccine if people cannot get it soon enough, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.

Members of Congress questioned whether federal officials were too rosy in their estimates of how much vaccine would be available and when, and companies said they were still struggling to produce immunizations against H1N1.

CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said 22.4 million doses were now available to states, which can get them a day after they order them.

&quot;It&apos;s quite likely that too little vaccine is one of the things that&apos;s making people more interested in getting vaccinated, frankly,&quot; Frieden told reporters.

&quot;We think it will get easier to find vaccine in the weeks that come.&quot;

President Barack Obama&apos;s daughters found it. &quot;Malia and Sasha were both vaccinated for H1N1 last week, after the vaccine became available to Washington, D.C. schoolchildren,&quot; a White House blog reads.

&quot;President and Mrs. Obama have not yet been vaccinated for H1N1, and they will wait until the needs of the priority groups identified by the CDC -- including young people under the age of 24, pregnant women, and people with underlying conditions -- have been met.&quot;

Many states and cities say they have received about one-tenth as much vaccine as they originally had expected by this time. Frieden said the delays may discourage people who are lining up for vaccine.

&quot;It is likely also as we produce more vaccine and as both people are given the opportunity to get vaccinated, and as disease maybe wanes in the future, we will have significant amounts of vaccine that can&apos;t be used,&quot; Frieden said.

&quot;One of the messages for states, localities and health providers is not to reserve vaccine that they have available, to give it out as soon as it comes in, because more is on the way.&quot;

In September, U.S. officials said 40 million vaccine doses would be available by the end of October and they estimated 20 million doses a week would be delivered, with a goal of 250 million doses by the end of flu season in March or April.

UNRELIABLE ESTIMATES

Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins asked why the estimates were so far off.

&quot;It now appears that much of the vaccine could arrive only after many people have already been infected with H1N1,&quot; she said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, released late on Monday.

&quot;It seems that HHS gave its assurance of sufficient supply in August without adequate information to make such a commitment.&quot;

Connecticut independent Senator Joseph Lieberman weighed in

on Tuesday.

&quot;Unfortunately, these missteps in estimating available doses of H1N1 vaccine have effects beyond just growing public frustration; they have the potential to critically undermine our vaccine distribution efforts, which depend on accurate estimates of vaccine availability,&quot; he said.

But HHS spokeswoman Jenny Backus said the agency was simply passing on information as it became available.

&quot;We have been very clear and open and told the American people what we know when we know it,&quot; she said in a telephone interview.

&quot;We have passed on the manufacturing estimates, and as they have changed, we have conveyed the information to the American people, too.&quot;

    <body>By Allan Dowd

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - Athletes and spectators will be encouraged to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu before traveling to next year&apos;s Winter Olympics in Vancouver, an official said on Wednesday.

The hundreds of volunteers and staff scheduled to work during the February Games are also being urged to get vaccinated as part of Canada&apos;s national immunization effort, which began this week.

An estimated 5,500 athletes and team officials are scheduled to be in Vancouver next year for the 17 days of competitions and they will be joined by thousands of media and spectators from around the world.

Health and Olympic officials are preparing instructions for athletes and visitors on how to deal with the pandemic strain of the flu, according to Dr. Jack Taunton, chief medical officer of the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC).

&quot;We would certainly encouraging all travelers coming to the Games in Vancouver to get H1N1 vaccinations as soon as it is available, but particularly 14 days in advance of coming here,&quot; Taunton said.

The 14 days time span ensures the vaccine&apos;s protections against the virus are fully active in the body.

Vaccinations are not mandatory in Canada, but Taunton was scheduled to get his own shot on Wednesday. Ottawa plans to have enough vaccine to allow all of Canada&apos;s more than 33 million people to each get a flu shot.

At least one, unnamed, Olympic team has said its athletes will not be able to obtain vaccines in advance of the Games so steps are being made to make shots available for them after they arrive, Taunton said.

Vaccine manufacturers have also assured organizers that the treatments will not cause athletes to fail any Olympic drug tests, he said.

Canada&apos;s will also experience its normal seasonal flu during the winter so athletes and visitors should also look at getting vaccinated against that regular flu virus, according to Taunton.

The H1N1 strain, also called swine flu, is already causing concern across Canada&apos;s athletic communities.

The Greater Toronto Hockey League, the largest amateur minor hockey league in the world, has urged teams to take special precautions against spreading the virus, following the sudden death of a 13-year-old player on Monday.

Health Canada also said on Wednesday it was preparing guideline for Canadian travelers to help reduce the virus&apos;s spread, and said it was encouraging travel companies to make it easier for people who feel ill to postpone any trips.

Organizers of the Vancouver Olympics have seen one positive benefit from public concern about the flu. They reached a sponsorship deal this summer with ALDA Pharmaceuticals Corp, which produces hand sanitizers.

Medical officials say hand washing is a critical component in efforts to stop the flu&apos;s spread.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor - Analysis

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - First came the jibes about the U.S. government rushing out an untested swine flu vaccine. Now, critics say it is not fast enough.

&quot;The premise that &apos;you can&apos;t win&apos; is part of the equation,&quot; said Dr. D.A. Henderson, who advised the administration of former president George W. Bush on pandemic preparedness.

It is a lesson playing out in real time by U.S. government health officials as the H1N1 pandemic turns from a scientific and logistical battle to a political one.

Plans have been in the works for handling a flu pandemic since 2003, when H5N1 avian influenza re-emerged in Asia. Health officials held roundtables and ran tabletop exercises, with journalists, bloggers and activists.

They knew it would take time to make a vaccine against a new flu strain and handle the delicate balance between communicating the need for the vaccine without sparking anxiety if manufacturers were unable to deliver it on time.

Now that the H1N1 flu pandemic has arrived, health officials are facing the inevitable, Henderson, who helped lead the vaccination effort that eliminated smallpox in 1979, said in an e-mail.

&quot;If one anticipates a potential disaster and is successful in having enough done to head it off, there is criticism of the energy and money expended for something that didn&apos;t happen. The converse is obvious.&quot;

QUESTIONING NEED AND SAFETY

For the most part, public health experts have praised the administration of President Barack Obama for how it has dealt with H1N1. Companies formulated a vaccine in a record five months. Antivirals and other supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile were pushed out.

The National Institutes of Health is conducting research on new antivirals and how best to slow the spread of flu.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has briefed the media frequently, and the agency is using new media such as pages on Facebook, updates on Twitter and videos on YouTube.

But now Health and Human Services is under fire for having miscalculated how much vaccine would become available and when. Officials said 40 million doses of vaccine would be available by the end of October, with 20 million a week rolling out after that. As of Tuesday, 22.4 million were ready.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius began making appearances in which she promised that every American who wanted a vaccine would get one and said 250 million doses were on order.

&quot;The one thing they have to stop saying is there is a dose for everybody,&quot; said Mike Osterholm, a former Minnesota public health official and expert on pandemic preparedness at the University of Minnesota.

&quot;The virus has been in a race with the vaccine and the virus is winning. It doesn&apos;t matter if there is a dose for everybody if it doesn&apos;t get to them before they become ill.&quot;

MILLIONS INFECTED

CDC has stopped trying to count how many people have caught swine flu, saying only that it is millions. Officially, 1,000 U.S. deaths have been attributed to H1N1 since April.

Members of Congress have begun to question the vaccine numbers. Republican Senator Susan Collins took Sebelius to task on Monday for having released estimates too soon, then herself demanded a new timetable of estimates.

Dr. Bruce Gellin, head of HHS&apos;s National Vaccine Program Office, defended the decision to give numbers as they became available and change them as necessary.

&quot;I think that all along was the pledge to be as transparent as we could at the time,&quot; Gellin said in a telephone interview.

States would have been overwhelmed if they had been told they would only get a few vaccines and then millions were dumped on them, he said.

The United States has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 swine flu vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Australia&apos;s CSL, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.

Except for MedImmune, all had problems making vaccine at first and are still struggling to make the virus grow in eggs, the first step to manufacturing influenza vaccine.

MedImmune has prolific production -- officials say the company can make 200 million doses of its nasal spray vaccine -- but only had 40 million sprayers to deliver it. The company is working with the federal government to perfect a device to drip the vaccine into the nose.

&quot;How did we do with this one? From my vantage point, we could have done far better had due attention been paid to history,&quot; said Henderson, a veteran of the last two flu pandemics in 1957 and 1968.

GENEVA, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation will issue new guidance on tackling the H1N1 flu virus next week, based on talks between vaccine experts that began in Geneva on Wednesday.

A WHO spokeswoman confirmed that the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), chaired by Britain&apos;s immunisation chief David Salisbury, was meeting but gave no details.

The 15-member group will tell WHO Director-General Margaret Chan who it recommends should be vaccinated against H1N1 flu and how many doses are needed, and Chan will review and circulate their suggestions.

The WHO&apos;s guidance on vaccinations is seen as pivotal for the pharmaceutical industry&apos;s investment decisions as well as government policies on buying and distributing vaccines against the swine flu virus.

The H1N1 virus has spread globally and killed nearly 5,000 people since appearing earlier this year, the WHO says. Symptoms have been mild in most patients but pregnant women and people with health problems like diabetes are seen at higher risk.

Earlier on Wednesday, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) said it would get a boost from H1N1 vaccine sales this year. [ID:nLR454208]

Its rivals such as Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Novartis (NOVN.VX) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) are also poised to benefit from governments&apos; mass immunisation campaigns.

In addition to pandemic flu, the SAGE panel will review broad immunisation priorities including routine vaccinations and emergency campaigns. The experts come from Britain, the United States, Syria, Pakistan, Thailand, Australia, Finland, Jamaica, China, Hong Kong, South Africa, Indonesia and Nigeria.

By Ben Hirschler

LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Sharply higher sales of flu drug Relenza buoyed GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) quarterly sales, and the British group said it was in line for a booster from its swine flu vaccine in the last three months of the year.

Third-quarter earnings per share growth of 13 percent, flattered by a weak pound, was just shy of expectations, while group revenue rose 15 percent, helped by recent diversification, the world&apos;s second-biggest drugmaker said on Wednesday.

Glaxo has lost plenty of business this year to cheap generics, as patents on its older medicines expire, resulting in a 12 percent fall in U.S. sales in the period.

But windfall sales of drugs and vaccines due to H1N1 are softening the blow.

As with many of its rivals, 2009 is turning out better than initially feared, and Chief Executive Andrew Witty said he expected further growth in the fourth quarter of the year, &quot;including significant sales of influenza products&quot;.

Glaxo said previously it had taken orders for 440 million doses of its H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix, and analysts say it could book around 1 billion pounds ($1.64 billion) of this business in the fourth quarter as immunisation campaigns get underway.

Witty told reporters that market expectations for sales of the vaccine were &quot;pretty close to being right&quot;, adding Glaxo had booked further orders and still had capacity for more.

European drugmakers Glaxo, Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Novartis (NOVN.VX) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) are set to win the bulk of the business for mass swine flu vaccination programmes launched by governments around the world.

Glaxo also gains from having the inhaled flu drug Relenza, which registered sales of 182 million pounds in the third quarter, against just 12 million pounds a year earlier.

Roche (ROG.VX) has seen a similar sharp jump in sales of its rival flu drug Tamiflu.

Glaxo&apos;s pretax profit totalled 2.07 billion pounds in the third quarter, equivalent to earnings per share before major restructuring of 28.5 pence, on sales of 6.76 billion.

The mean consensus forecast had been for earnings of 28.7p and sales of 6.81 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said the results were broadly in line, helped substantially by currencies.

&quot;GSK has a decent revenue and EPS profile through 2015, but its valuation seems to reflect this already,&quot; he added, as shares in the group traded 1 percent lower in a London market down 1.8 percent at 1400 GMT.

MOVING ON FROM &quot;WHITE PILLS&quot;

While H1N1 may be a one-off, Witty said his strategy of diversifying away from reliance on &quot;white pills in Western markets&quot; would mean more predictable long-term growth, as emerging market and consumer products sales increase.

Less than 30 percent of third-quarter sales were generated from traditional pharmaceuticals and markets, compared with 38 percent last year.

&quot;What we&apos;ve begun to show very clearly in these results is the change in dynamics in our business and particularly the good progress we are making towards diversifying our portfolio,&quot; he said.

Witty added he would continue to look actively for bolt-on acquisitions, but only if the price was right. He has eschewed large-scale acquisitions of the kind pursued this year by Pfizer (PFE.N) and Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N).

Progress on the research front included encouraging results with experimental heart drug darapladib, which Witty said was now six months ahead of schedule in late-stage clinical trials.

Glaxo trades at about 10.4 times forecast 2010 earnings, a premium to AstraZeneca and Sanofi, which report on Thursday and Friday respectively, but a discount to Swiss rivals Roche and Novartis. (Additional reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Will Waterman) ($1=.6107 Pound)</body>

In addition to pandemic flu, the SAGE panel will review broad immunization priorities including routine vaccinations and emergency campaigns. The experts come from Britain, the United States, Syria, Pakistan, Thailand, Australia, Finland, Jamaica, China, Hong Kong, South Africa, Indonesia and Nigeria.

    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington Capitals forward Quintin Laing has been diagnosed with swine flu, becoming the third National Hockey League player to contract the virus this week.

Canadian Laing, who missed Washington&apos;s 4-2 win over the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday, is having treatment while being kept away from his team mates, the Capitals said on Wednesday.

&quot;If you are showing the symptoms and you don&apos;t have the seasonal flu, then the presumption is that you have H1N1,&quot; Nate Ewell, senior director of media relations, told reporters.

Asked what precautions the Capitals were taking to combat the H1N1 flu pandemic, Ewell replied: &quot;None beyond what we&apos;ve done all along which is educate the guys as well as we can.&quot;

Edmonton Oilers defenseman Ladislav Smid and backup Colorado Avalanche goaltender Peter Budaj were diagnosed with swine flue this week.

Officially, 1,000 U.S. deaths have been attributed to H1N1 since April.

    <body>* Production ramping up as yields increase

* Glaxo a &quot;bit-part player&quot; in U.S. H1N1 market

LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Production yields for H1N1 swine flu vaccine are now increasing and output should reach full throttle in around a month&apos;s time, the chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) said on Wednesday.

Major vaccine producers have been struggling with low yields, leading to lower than expected shipments and a scramble for supplies in some markets -- notably the United States.

But Glaxo&apos;s Andrew Witty, presenting third-quarter financial results, said things were getting better.

&quot;Yes, yield is improving&quot;, he said. &quot;I would expect us to be at full pace by about four weeks or so from now ... the likely final yield is going to be pretty good compared to historic flu strains.&quot;

Glaxo is one of the world&apos;s largest manufacturers of flu vaccines, along with Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

It is not, however, a big source of vaccine for the United States, since its main H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix contains an adjuvant, or additive, and is not being used there.

Glaxo is still awaiting regulatory approval for a non-adjuvanted version of the vaccine for the U.S. market.

&quot;To be honest with you, we are a little bit of a bit-part player in the U.S. flu scenario,&quot; Witty said, adding the around 7.5 million doses it expected to deliver were a &quot;tiny fraction&quot; of total U.S. needs.

Worldwide, Glaxo has taken orders for more than 440 million doses of Pandemrix. (Reporting by Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland)</body>

* Says WHO has helped 121 countries get H1N1 medicine

By Jeff Franks

HAVANA, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro &quot;looks wonderful,&quot; World Health Organization director general Margaret Chan said on Wednesday, after meeting the 83-year-old who resigned the presidency last year due to ailing health.

Chan, speaking at the end of her first visit to Cuba, said she met with Castro for more two hours on Tuesday during which he displayed a &quot;truly impressive&quot; knowledge of healthcare issues and looked to be in good condition.

&quot;I&apos;m a doctor, I understand the importance of confidentiality, but I have to say he looks wonderful,&quot; Chan told a press conference in Havana.

When their talk was over, &quot;I was humbled. He walked me out of the house -- that&apos;s quite a distance, so pretty strong,&quot; she said of his condition.

Castro has not been seen in public except for videos and photos since July 2006 when he underwent intestinal surgery.

In February 2008, after taking power in a 1959 revolution and holding it for 49 years, he quit the presidency, citing age and health issues, and was succeeded by younger brother Raul Castro, 78.

Fidel Castro still meets with visiting dignitaries and writes columns, usually about international affairs, for Cuban media.

In a 24-minute video shown on Cuban television in August, he looked fit as he spoke with a group of Venezuelan law students, but rumors still pop up occasionally that he is at death&apos;s door.

Chan said she toured Cuban medical facilities and came away impressed with the communist-led island&apos;s health system, which provides free care to all Cubans.

Citing its strong health indicators on such things as life expectancy and infant mortality, she said, &quot;In a country of this level of economic development, to be able to achieve those very good health indices is not easy.&quot;

Cuba, she said, &quot;has the right vision and the right direction. Health is a state policy and health is seen as a right of the people.&quot;

Cuba&apos;s health system is widely praised for its preventative measures and basic care, but also suffers from problems such as shortages of medicine and equipment and badly maintained facilities. The government blames the U.S. trade embargo against the island for many of the system&apos;s deficiencies.

Chan said the World Health Organization has helped 121 countries, including Cuba, stockpile doses of the medicine Tamiflu to treat H1N1 flu, which has killed nearly 5,000 people globally since appearing earlier this year.

She said the organization is working to procure H1N1 vaccines for developing countries and so far &quot;we have pledges from the vaccine manufacturers and development partners to a total of 200 million doses.&quot;

She said the vaccines would become available over the next year and be distributed to &quot;about 100 countries,&quot; likely including Cuba. (Reporting by Jeff Franks; Editing by Tom Brown and Vicki Allen)</body>

* Futures, cash prices under pressure

* WTO process long to resolve complaints

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 28 (Reuters) - A series of trade restrictions on Canadian farm products this year has ratcheted up the pressure on farmers, many of whom say the barriers reflect protectionism rather than genuine concern over food safety.

From China to Europe, various foreign markets have banned shipments of Canadian-produced raw materials for cattle feed, vegetable oil, linoleum flooring and hot dogs, driving down prices at the farm gate.

Making matters worse, the trade bans causing farmers so much pain seem strangely arbitrary to many Canadians.

&quot;A lot of it comes down to recessionary (pressure) that they&apos;re under,&quot; Canadian Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said on Wednesday. Export markets &quot;tend to get more protectionist as they safeguard their own folks.&quot;

As for the specific restrictions, Ritz said: &quot;Some are based on a bit of reality, some are a real stretch.&quot;

Whatever the basis for trade restrictions, the results are clear. ICE Canada canola futures RSX9 plunged 4 percent Thursday with news China would not accept Canadian canola with blackleg disease. Prices of flax, cattle and hogs, which have also been targeted, are also under pressure.

Much of the price pain traces to disingenuous safety concerns, Canadian agriculture sources say. In particular:

* China&apos;s ban on Canadian and Australian canola with blackleg targets a disease already present in China. Some analysts believe China is seeking to draw down its supply of canola, which is crushed for use in vegetable oil.

* Four Canadian canola-crushing plants owned by Cargill [CARG.UL], Viterra (VT.TO) and two by Bunge (BG.N) are under U.S. shipping restrictions because of salmonella bacteria in meal shipments. Salmonella is a serious concern in human food, but canola meal is cattle feed. Some believe the Obama administration is scoring political points based on food-illness fears. Even so, U.S. food safety officials maintain that animal feeds can act as vehicles for transmitting harmful bacteria to humans and animals.

* A U.S. country-of-origin labelling law has sharply reduced Canadian cattle and hog exports to the United States. Some U.S. packers and farm groups oppose the law, causing Canadian farmers to suspect reflects effective lobbying by certain cattle groups rather than food traceability concerns.

Restricting imports gives an immediate boost to local farmers, said William Kerr, a professor in agricultural economics at University of Saskatchewan.

Canada, which is under more trade restrictions at one time than usual, is a target because it is a big farm product producer, Kerr said.

Consumers&apos; voice is also finding more ears, leading to other trade bans:

* Flax, used in food and industrial uses like flooring, lost its top market Europe this summer after two dozen countries found genetically modified flaxseed in Canadian flax shipments [ID:nN05373740]. European consumers are reluctant to eat GMO food because of concerns about unproven long-term health effects. Stricter regulation in Canada of GMO crops is needed to prevent similar threats to farmers, the National Farmers Union of Canada has said.

* More than a dozen countries, notably Russia, banned North American pork in spring after the discovery of the H1N1 flu virus on a Canadian hog farm. The World Health Organization said pork is safe to eat, but the bans were slow to disappear.

&quot;The H1N1 thing is (about) politicians covering their butts essentially and in direct violation of international agreements,&quot; Kerr said.

That points to another reality -- the WTO complaint process isn&apos;t swift enough to prevent industry pain, Kerr said.

&quot;Any time you&apos;re banned from a market, you&apos;re going to suffer. The unfortunate thing is we probably would win some of these cases at the WTO, but it takes a long time.&quot;

    <summary>... lost plenty of business this year to cheap generics, as patents on its older medicines expire, but windfall sales of drugs and vaccines due to H1N1 will soften ...</summary>
    <body>LONDON (Reuters) - Sharply higher sales of flu drug Relenza buoyed GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s quarterly sales and the British group said it was in line for a big swine flu vaccine boost in the last three months of the year.

Third quarter earnings per share growth of 13 percent, flattered by a weak pound, was just shy of expectations while group revenue rose 15 percent, helped by recent diversification, the world&apos;s second biggest drugmaker said on Wednesday.

Glaxo has lost plenty of business this year to cheap generics, as patents on its older medicines expire, but windfall sales of drugs and vaccines due to H1N1 will soften the blow.

As with many of its rivals, 2009 is turning out better than initially feared and Chief Executive Andrew Witty said he expected further growth in the fourth quarter of this year &quot;including significant sales of influenza products.&quot;

Glaxo has taken orders for 440 million doses of its H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix and analysts believe it could book around 1 billion pounds ($1.64 billion) of this business in the fourth quarter as immunization campaigns get underway.

European companies drugmakers Glaxo, Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis and AstraZeneca are set to win the bulk of the business for mass swine flu vaccination programs launched by governments around the world.

Roche, meanwhile, has seen a sharp jump in sales of flu drug Tamiflu, a rival to Glaxo&apos;s Relenza.

Glaxo&apos;s pre-tax profit totaled 2.07 billion pounds in the third quarter, equivalent to earnings per share before major restructuring of 28.5 pence, on sales of 6.76 billion.

The mean consensus forecast had been for earnings of 28.7p and sales of 6.81 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Glaxo trades at about 10.4 times forecast 2010 earnings, a premium to AstraZeneca and Sanofi -- which report on Thursday and Friday respectively -- but a discount to Swiss rivals Roche and Novartis.

    <body>By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc (WLP.N) posted an 11 percent drop in profit as Americans losing their jobs also lost insurance coverage, but results crushed estimates on favorable medical costs, changes to its Medicare plans and shedding of unprofitable Medicaid contracts.

Still, WellPoint warned that it expected higher medical costs for the full year, owing in part to expenses tied to the flu and Cobra coverage for workers who lost their jobs.

It also forecast lower operating earnings next year, repeating its bearish view for 2010, although it put off giving details until early next year.

&quot;It&apos;s a good, solid bottom-line number in the quarter,&quot; Collins Stewart analyst Brian Wright said. &quot;Commentary for the rest of the year and pricing and cost trends seems a bit cautious from management.&quot;

Shares of WellPoint, the largest health insurer by membership, were 0.5 percent lower, but the decline was less than rivals on an overall down day for the stock market.

WellPoint&apos;s net income fell to $730.2 million, or $1.53 per share, from $820.7 million, or $1.60 per share, a year earlier. The latest results included a charge of 28 cents per share for impairment of intangible assets.

Excluding the charge and investment gains, the company earned $1.78 per share, well ahead of the analysts&apos; average estimate of $1.37, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue slipped 0.7 percent to $15.21 billion but was higher than the $15.15 billion expected by analysts.

WellPoint followed UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) in reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results while expressing caution about 2010.

Shares of health insurers are trading at historic lows over concerns that the healthcare overhaul under debate in Congress will dramatically undercut their business.

WellPoint executives said they want more clarity on reform, in particular a potential industry-wide fee of $6.7 billion, as well as the severity of the H1N1 swine flu season before providing Wall Street with a more detailed 2010 outlook.

&quot;There are a number of moving pieces right now, and we thought it wouldn&apos;t be really the right thing to do to come forward with guidance with all the caveats that we&apos;d be describing,&quot; WellPoint Chief Executive Officer Angela Braly said in an interview.

WellPoint reported enrollment of 33.9 million as of September 30, down 4.2 percent from a year earlier.

Operating profit in the consumer business more than doubled to $520 million. Results were bolstered by product changes in the company&apos;s Medicare business and withdrawal from unprofitable contracts in its Medicaid business.

Profit fell 31 percent to $628 million in its commercial unit serving employers, hurt by lower enrollment. Higher administrative costs, from an increase in compensation and spending for technology and customer service, hurt results.

Overall, WellPoint spent 81.1 percent of its premium revenue on medical costs, less than 82.5 percent a year earlier and lower than several analysts expected.

But it said medical costs would rise around 9 percent for 2009, plus or minus 0.5 percent, which is slightly higher than its prior view. One factor in the higher cost outlook is government information and internal pharmacy data show spiking flu trends, Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said.

The other is people using Cobra insurance, who in general tend to be higher users of medical services. DeVeydt said some Americans also may soon lose their Cobra coverage and decide to undergo elective surgery or use other services before they do.

Analysts expressed concern WellPoint may not have accounted for the higher medical costs for its already-resolved contracts for 2010, potentially hurting profits, but DeVeydt said the company was prepared.

&quot;We expect both of those to have a pretty significant impact in the fourth quarter, and we&apos;re pricing ahead for that,&quot; DeVeydt said in an interview.

The company backed its previous forecast for 2009 net income of $5.06 to $5.12 per share. Excluding investment losses and the impairment charge, WellPoint&apos;s forecast rose to a range of $5.86 to $5.92 per share, compared with $5.60 to $5.66 previously. Analysts looked for $5.67.

WellPoint shares were down 24 cents at $46.46 on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Tuesday, the stock had risen about 11 percent this year, compared with a 6.6 percent rise for the S&amp;P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO.

But it said medical costs would rise around 9 percent for 2009, plus or minus 0.5 percent, which is slightly higher than its prior view. One factor in the higher cost outlook is government information and internal pharmacy data show spiking flu trends, Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said.

The other is people using Cobra insurance, who in general tend to be higher users of medical services. DeVeydt said some Americans also may soon lose their Cobra coverage and decide to undergo elective surgery or use other services before they do.

Analysts expressed concern WellPoint may not have accounted for the higher medical costs for its already-resolved contracts for 2010, potentially hurting profits, but DeVeydt said the company was prepared.

&quot;We expect both of those to have a pretty significant impact in the fourth quarter, and we&apos;re pricing ahead for that,&quot; DeVeydt said in an interview.

The company backed its previous forecast for 2009 net income of $5.06 to $5.12 per share. Excluding investment losses and the impairment charge, WellPoint&apos;s forecast rose to a range of $5.86 to $5.92 per share, compared with $5.60 to $5.66 previously. Analysts looked for $5.67.

WellPoint shares were down 24 cents at $46.46 on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Tuesday, the stock had risen about 11 percent this year, compared with a 6.6 percent rise for the S&amp;P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO.

    <body>* To cut jobs primarily in research and development

* Job cuts follow earlier decision to drop cancer drug trial

* Sees severance-related charge of $0.3 mln

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Drugmaker SciClone Pharmaceuticals Inc (SCLN.O) said it would cut about 17 percent of its U.S.-based jobs, mostly in research and development, following its decision to drop the development of its cancer drug earlier this month.

On Oct. 2, the company said it discontinued the development of its experimental pancreatic cancer drug after a recommendation by a data safety monitoring committee. [ID:nBNG485749]

SciClone said it expects to record a charge of about $0.3 million, which includes severance and other expenses associated with the workforce reduction.

The restructuring is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter, the company said in a statement.

The company has lately come to prominence as it is trying to get its hepatitis B treatment Zadaxin to show that it can boost the effectiveness of H1N1 flu vaccines now being developed by other companies.

SciClone sells Zadaxin, a drug approved in China and other overseas markets, to treat hepatitis B infections and to boost the immune systems of other patients, including those with liver cancer.

Shares of the company closed at $2.52 Tuesday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Esha Dey in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)</body>

    <body>* Weak commodity prices weigh on miners, energy firms

* Banks under pressure on continuing break-up fears

* Defensive telecoms, food retailers gain

By Harpreet Bhal

LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Britain&apos;s top shares fell 2.3 percent to hit a three-week closing low on Wednesday, dragged down by falls in energy stocks after BG Group (BG.L) posted a sharp drop in net profit, while miners tracked weaker metals.

The market also came under pressure on data showing new U.S. homes sales unexpectedly tumbled in September, their first drop in six months, underscoring the hazards to an economic recovery that businesses appeared to be banking on. [ID:nN28295073]

The FTSE 100 .FTSE closed down 120.55 points at 5,080.42, on the 80th anniversary of the &quot;Black Monday&quot; stock market crash of 1929, and posted its biggest one-day percentage fall since July 2.

The FTSE has rallied 47 percent since hitting a floor in March. After three months of consecutive gains from July to September, the index is on course to post its first monthly decline in four months.

&quot;When you see the quality of economic data coming out which at best is average and you have a 50 percent rally in the last seven months, something has to give. We are just having a reality check here,&quot; said David Buik, senior partner at BGC Partners.

Miners were the biggest drag, underpinned by lower metals prices on worries about rising inventories and poor demand. Xstrata (XTA.L), Lonmin (LMI.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L) and BHP Billiton (BLT.L) shed 6.1 to 9.4 percent.

Vedanta Resources (VED.L) lost 4.2 percent, pressured by a broker downgrade by Barclays Capital to &quot;equal weight&quot; from &quot;overweight&quot;. Kazakhmyz (KAZ.L), which reports third-quarter output numbers on Thursday, was 9.1 percent lower.

BG Group (BG.L) fell 3.3 percent, after posting a 44 percent drop in third-quarter net profit to 484 million pounds ($792.5 million) as gas and oil prices plummeted, though its underlying profits beat forecasts. [ID:nLS609784]

BP (BP.L) shed 1.7 percent a day after posting forecast-beating results. Citigroup cut its rating for the oil major to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; on its judgement that the firm&apos;s operational recovery is peaking.

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L) declined 1.2 to 5.2 percent ahead of their third-quarter results on Thursday. Weaker crude prices CLc1 also weighed on the sector.

BANKS UNDER PRESSURE

The banking sector extended its decline, with the break-up of Dutch financial services group ING (ING.AS) continuing to weigh heavily on its UK peers. Investors are unsettled by mounting fears over the disposals government-backed banks will have to make in order to satisfy the European Commission.

Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), Barclays (BARC.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and HSBC (HSBA.L) fell 1.3 to 6.1 percent.

In the wake of ING&apos;s split, Britain&apos;s state-owned lender Northern Rock got clearance from European regulators to be broken up on Wednesday, paving the way for a sale.[ID:nLS302436]

&quot;Investors are also apprehensive ahead of important U.S. GDP numbers tomorrow which are expected to show the world&apos;s biggest economy is coming out of a technical recession,&quot; said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads.

Life insurers were also weak, with Prudential (PRU.L), Legal &amp; General (LGEN.L), Old Mutual (OML.L) and Standard Life (SL.L) down 2.7 to 9.8 percent.

Prudential posted a better-than-expected 9 percent drop in third-quarter sales as its Asian region and U.S. businesses offset weakness at home. [ID:nLR176463]

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) dropped 0.4 percent. The drugmaker posted broadly in-line sales of 6.76 billion pounds and expects a big H1N1 vaccine boost in the fourth quarter.[ID:nLR454208].

AstraZeneca (AZN.L) lost 1.5 percent ahead of its third-quarter numbers on Thursday, while Shire (SHP.L), which is due to report quarterly figures on Friday, slipped 0.9 percent.

On the upside, telecoms stocks were higher with mobile heavyweight Vodafone (VOD.L) up 0.3 percent and Inmarsat (ISA.L) adding 0.6 percent as Barclays Capital initiated coverage on the European telecommunications sector with a positive view.

Defensive utility food retailers also gained ground, with Tesco (TSCO.L) and WM Morrison (MRW.L) up 1.9 and 1.3 percent. Tesco also benefitted from optimism about its expansion into financial services. [ID:nLS605271] (Editing by Rupert Winchester)</body>

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Canadian hog farmers have reduced the country&apos;s herd to its smallest size in at least five years, but more dramatic reductions may lie ahead once hard-hit farmers receive government downsizing incentives.

The hog inventory on Canadian farmers fell 7.3 percent between the third quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.

Canadian hog farmers have suffered for several years from a crushing combination of low prices, high feed costs and a volatile Canadian dollar. Discovery of the H1N1 flu in an Alberta pig herd in April resulted in more than a dozen countries banning Canadian pork, although most have since restored imports.

Canada is one of the world&apos;s leading pork exporters.

&quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;re nearly as far down the downsizing road as we&apos;re going to get,&quot; said Neil Ketilson, general manager of Sask Pork, an organization of farmers in the western province of Saskatchewan. &quot;We&apos;ve had some relief on feed costs, but the price of hogs is terrible.&quot;

Farmers had 11.8 million hogs on their farms on Oct. 1, down from 12.7 million on the same date last year. The hog herd had been dropping at a 6.7 percent rate when Statscan last measured supplies on July 1.

Most damaging has been the United States country of origin food labelling law that has resulted in American meat packers reducing imports of hogs and cattle from Canada to avoid costs of segregating foreign from domestic supplies.

Hog farmers exported 1.6 million hogs during the third quarter, with year to date exports of 5 million head, down 31.5 percent from the same period in 2008. The U.S. is by far Canada&apos;s largest export market for livestock.

Lean hog futures LCc1 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which influence prices paid in Canada, have increased since August but are down 5.5 percent from a year ago at $54.85 per cwt early on Wednesday.

Money from a C$75 million ($70 million) fund that the Canadian government earmarked on Aug. 15 to encouraging hog farmers to close their barns for at least three years has not yet reached farmers. Farmers are required to bid the amount of money they would accept to idle their barns, with the first wave of bids opened Nov. 4.

Interest is running high in the funds to cease production, Ketilson said.

The inventory of pigs kept for breeding and number of farrowed sows have also fallen to at least five-year lows, Statscan said, which suggests the overall herd downsizing trend will continue.

Maple Leaf Foods (MFI.TO) and Olymel L.P., the two biggest hog processors in Canada, should see ample supplies in the short term as farmers slaughter their hogs and face reduced access to the U.S., Ketilson said. Domestic slaughter is up 5.9 percent in the third quarter, likely reflecting increased production by Olymel, he said.

In the longer term, supply could become a bigger concern for packers, who have lost money on hog processing of late, Ketilson said.

    <body>Oct 28 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- The deaths of two young, previously healthy children are bound to terrify families, and to ramp up the fear related to H1N1 influenza several notches.

Many parents are now wondering: Should they keep their kids home from school, should they keep them away from hockey practice and gymnastics and should they - horror of horrors - put the kibosh on Halloween? The answer to those questions is no - an equivocal no.

- Twelve people, including six international workers, were killed and several others injured when gunmen raided a United Nations-approved guest-house in the Afghan capital just after dawn on Wednesday morning.

- A car bomb killed at least 80 people and wounded about 100 on Wednesday in a crowded market in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, officials said, the latest in a series of bloody militant attacks.

BUSINESS:

- Telus Corp (T.TO) is about to reduce wireless charges, giving customers relief from the industry&apos;s long-standing practice of tacking fees on top of monthly bills.

The move will effectively kill the dreaded system access fee, but it could force investors to rethink their bets on the telecom industry.

- Canwest Global Communications Corp CGS.TO has announced it will be transferring the National Post newspaper to its publishing division.

In a statement released late Tuesday, Canwest said that under the terms of the agreement, all National Post employees will be offered employment with the new company.

NATIONAL POST:

- Afghan forces exchanged gunfire with a group of militants holed up inside an international guest house in the centre of Kabul on Wednesday, police said.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for taking a number of U.N. workers hostage.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Under growing pressure by Canadians to address the shortfalls in retirement savings and pension plans, the federal government announced a series of measures designed to appease pensioners and asset managers.

But the pension reforms announced by Jim Flaherty, the Minister of Finance, are considered little more than &quot;housekeeping&quot; changes to outdated tax rules.

- Canada&apos;s dollar edged higher against the U.S. currency on Tuesday as the market took comments by Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney as signaling there is less risk that the central bank will intervene directly to tame the currency&apos;s rise.

- Toronto stocks recorded a third day of triple-digit losses on Tuesday after the U.S. consumer confidence index fell to its lowest level in 41 years, causing a drag on metal and mining stocks.</body>

    <body>* Glaxo has yet to get FDA approval for vaccine

* Senator asked why HHS made promises

* Novartis, CSL working to improve production

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) has yet to get U.S. government approval for its swine flu vaccine, the company said on Tuesday, while Novartis (NOVN.VX) said it was still struggling to make vaccines.

A U.S. senator accused the Health and Human Services department of over-promising how many and how quickly H1N1 vaccines could be delivered, as disgruntled people lined up outside clinics across the United States seeking immunization.

The United States has contracted with its five suppliers of seasonal influenza vaccine to also deliver H1N1 vaccine, but has sharply cut initial estimates of how much will be delivered this month and next. HHS says companies are having more trouble than anticipated making the vaccine, which is grown in chicken eggs using 50-year-old technology.

Glaxo, which signed a broad agreement earlier this year with HHS for $250 million of pandemic products including vaccines, says its vaccine has yet to be approved by FDA, although it submitted it in September.

&quot;We are working with the HHS to determine how we can best meet their needs and final shipping dates will not be known until these discussions and the regulatory approval process have been completed,&quot; said Glaxo spokeswoman Claire Brough.

Australian vaccine maker CSL(CSL.AX) said the FDA had released five lots of its vaccine. &quot;In terms of H1N1 vaccine production, CSL is working as quickly and efficiently as possible to manufacture H1N1 vaccine antigen and is making good progress,&quot; a spokeswoman said in an e-mail.

Part of the problem is the &quot;seed&quot; strain -- the virus sample sent to companies to make vaccine with -- did not grow particularly well in eggs.

NEW STRAIN

&quot;The company is using a new H1N1 virus seed strain which is providing better yields than the original seed strain that all manufacturers were given back in May. This is helping CSL produce more vaccine antigen more quickly than before,&quot; the spokeswoman said.

She said a new U.S. facility in Illinois got FDA approval in September and was now packaging vaccines.

Novartis was also struggling.

&quot;Yes the yields are lower than initially expected, with delays to the volume available,&quot; said spokesman Eric Althoff, adding that the Swiss group had informed the U.S. government about the lower yields through the whole process.

HHS initially predicted it would have distributed 40 million doses of vaccine by the end of October, but only 16 million have been parceled out.

AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit has had no trouble producing nasal spray vaccine, which was the first available to the U.S, market, while Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) said on Friday it was on track to deliver more than 75 million doses.

Maine Republican Susan Collins asked why the estimates were so far off.

&quot;I am troubled that HHS has assured the public since August that the government would have enough vaccine to meet demand,&quot; she said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, released late on Monday. &quot;It now appears that much of the vaccine could arrive only after many people have already been infected with H1N1.&quot;

Collins cited a Purdue University study that predicted that nearly 60 percent of the American population would be infected with H1N1, of whom a third would fall ill, and that last week would see the peak of infections.

&quot;It seems that HHS gave its assurance of sufficient supply in August without adequate information to make such a commitment,&quot; she said.

An HHS spokesman had no immediate comment. (With reporting by Ben Hirschler in London and Sam Cage in Zurich)

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government may end up throwing away unused doses of swine flu vaccine if people cannot get it soon enough, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.

Members of Congress questioned whether federal officials were too rosy in their estimates of how much vaccine would be available and when, and companies said they were still struggling to produce immunizations against H1N1.

CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said 22.4 million doses were now available to states, which can get them a day after they order them.

&quot;It&apos;s quite likely that that too little vaccine is one of the things that&apos;s making people more interested in getting vaccinated, frankly,&quot; Frieden told reporters.

&quot;We think it will get easier to find vaccine in the weeks that come.&quot;

Many states and cities say they have received about one-tenth as much vaccine as they originally had expected by this time. Frieden said the delays may discourage people who are lining up for vaccine.

&quot;It is likely also as we produce more vaccine and as both people are given the opportunity to get vaccinated, and as disease maybe wanes in the future, we will have significant amounts of vaccine that can&apos;t be used,&quot; Frieden said.

&quot;One of the messages for states, localities and health providers is not to reserve vaccine that they have available, to give it out as soon as it comes in, because more is on the way.&quot;

In September, U.S. officials said 40 million vaccine doses would be available by the end of October and they estimated 20 million doses a week would be delivered, with a goal of 250 million doses by the end of flu season in March or April.

UNRELIABLE ESTIMATES

Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins asked why the estimates were so far off.

&quot;It now appears that much of the vaccine could arrive only after many people have already been infected with H1N1,&quot; she said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, released late on Monday.

&quot;It seems that HHS gave its assurance of sufficient supply in August without adequate information to make such a commitment.&quot;

Connecticut independent Senator Joseph Lieberman weighed in

on Tuesday.

&quot;Unfortunately, these missteps in estimating available doses of H1N1 vaccine have effects beyond just growing public frustration; they have the potential to critically undermine our vaccine distribution efforts, which depend on accurate estimates of vaccine availability,&quot; he said.

But HHS spokeswoman Jenny Backus said the agency was simply passing on information as it became available.

&quot;We have been very clear and open and told the American people what we know when we know it,&quot; she said in a telephone interview.

&quot;We have passed on the manufacturing estimates, and as they have changed, we have conveyed the information to the American people, too.&quot;

Vaccine makers and government researchers alike have complained about the reliance on outdated and unpredictable vaccine manufacturing methods that use chicken eggs.

The virus has spread much faster than vaccine can be delivered, and Frieden estimates that millions of Americans have been infected. While not especially deadly, it is affecting young adults and children who normally escape the most serious consequences of seasonal flu.

&quot;It is likely also as we produce more vaccine and as both people are given the opportunity to get vaccinated, and as disease maybe wanes in the future, we will have significant amounts of vaccine that can&apos;t be used,&quot; Frieden said.

&quot;One of the messages for states, localities and health providers is not to reserve vaccine that they have available, to give it out as soon as it comes in, because more is on the way.&quot;

In September, U.S. officials said 40 million vaccine doses would be available by the end of October and they estimated 20 million doses a week would be delivered, with a goal of 250 million doses by the end of flu season in March or April.

UNRELIABLE ESTIMATES

Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins asked why the estimates were so far off.

&quot;It now appears that much of the vaccine could arrive only after many people have already been infected with H1N1,&quot; she said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, released late on Monday.

&quot;It seems that HHS gave its assurance of sufficient supply in August without adequate information to make such a commitment.&quot;

Connecticut independent Senator Joseph Lieberman weighed in on Tuesday.

&quot;Unfortunately, these missteps in estimating available doses of H1N1 vaccine have effects beyond just growing public frustration; they have the potential to critically undermine our vaccine distribution efforts, which depend on accurate estimates of vaccine availability,&quot; he said.

But HHS spokeswoman Jenny Backus said the agency was simply passing on information as it became available.

&quot;We have been very clear and open and told the American people what we know when we know it,&quot; she said in a telephone interview.

&quot;We have passed on the manufacturing estimates, and as they have changed, we have conveyed the information to the American people, too.&quot;

Vaccine makers and government researchers alike have complained about the reliance on outdated and unpredictable vaccine manufacturing methods that use chicken eggs.

The virus has spread much faster than vaccine can be delivered, and Frieden estimates that millions of Americans have been infected. While not especially deadly, it is affecting young adults and children who normally escape the most serious consequences of seasonal flu.

    <body>* Weak commodity prices weigh on miners, energy firms

* Banks under pressure on continuing break-up fears

* Defensive telecoms, food retailers gain

By Harpreet Bhal

LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Britain&apos;s top shares fell 2.3 percent to hit a three-week closing low on Wednesday, dragged down by falls in energy stocks after BG Group (BG.L) posted a sharp drop in net profit, while miners tracked weaker metals.

The market also came under pressure on data showing new U.S. homes sales unexpectedly tumbled in September, their first drop in six months, underscoring the hazards to an economic recovery that businesses appeared to be banking on. [ID:nN28295073]

The FTSE 100 .FTSE closed down 120.55 points at 5,080.42, on the 80th anniversary of the &quot;Black Monday&quot; stock market crash of 1929, and posted its biggest one-day percentage fall since July 2.

The FTSE has rallied 47 percent since hitting a floor in March. After three months of consecutive gains from July to September, the index is on course to post its first monthly decline in four months.

&quot;When you see the quality of economic data coming out which at best is average and you have a 50 percent rally in the last seven months, something has to give. We are just having a reality check here,&quot; said David Buik, senior partner at BGC Partners.

Miners were the biggest drag, underpinned by lower metals prices on worries about rising inventories and poor demand. Xstrata (XTA.L), Lonmin (LMI.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L) and BHP Billiton (BLT.L) shed 6.1 to 9.4 percent.

Vedanta Resources (VED.L) lost 4.2 percent, pressured by a broker downgrade by Barclays Capital to &quot;equal weight&quot; from &quot;overweight&quot;. Kazakhmyz (KAZ.L), which reports third-quarter output numbers on Thursday, was 9.1 percent lower.

BG Group (BG.L) fell 3.3 percent, after posting a 44 percent drop in third-quarter net profit to 484 million pounds ($792.5 million) as gas and oil prices plummeted, though its underlying profits beat forecasts. [ID:nLS609784]

BP (BP.L) shed 1.7 percent a day after posting forecast-beating results. Citigroup cut its rating for the oil major to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; on its judgement that the firm&apos;s operational recovery is peaking.

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L) declined 1.2 to 5.2 percent ahead of their third-quarter results on Thursday. Weaker crude prices CLc1 also weighed on the sector.

BANKS UNDER PRESSURE

The banking sector extended its decline, with the break-up of Dutch financial services group ING (ING.AS) continuing to weigh heavily on its UK peers. Investors are unsettled by mounting fears over the disposals government-backed banks will have to make in order to satisfy the European Commission.

Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), Barclays (BARC.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and HSBC (HSBA.L) fell 1.3 to 6.1 percent.

In the wake of ING&apos;s split, Britain&apos;s state-owned lender Northern Rock got clearance from European regulators to be broken up on Wednesday, paving the way for a sale.[ID:nLS302436]

&quot;Investors are also apprehensive ahead of important U.S. GDP numbers tomorrow which are expected to show the world&apos;s biggest economy is coming out of a technical recession,&quot; said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads.

Life insurers were also weak, with Prudential (PRU.L), Legal &amp; General (LGEN.L), Old Mutual (OML.L) and Standard Life (SL.L) down 2.7 to 9.8 percent.

Prudential posted a better-than-expected 9 percent drop in third-quarter sales as its Asian region and U.S. businesses offset weakness at home. [ID:nLR176463]

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) dropped 0.4 percent. The drugmaker posted broadly in-line sales of 6.76 billion pounds and expects a big H1N1 vaccine boost in the fourth quarter.[ID:nLR454208].

AstraZeneca (AZN.L) lost 1.5 percent ahead of its third-quarter numbers on Thursday, while Shire (SHP.L), which is due to report quarterly figures on Friday, slipped 0.9 percent.

On the upside, telecoms stocks were higher with mobile heavyweight Vodafone (VOD.L) up 0.3 percent and Inmarsat (ISA.L) adding 0.6 percent as Barclays Capital initiated coverage on the European telecommunications sector with a positive view.

Defensive utility food retailers also gained ground, with Tesco (TSCO.L) and WM Morrison (MRW.L) up 1.9 and 1.3 percent. Tesco also benefitted from optimism about its expansion into financial services. [ID:nLS605271] (Editing by Rupert Winchester)</body>

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Canadian hog farmers have reduced the country&apos;s herd to its smallest size in at least five years, but more dramatic reductions may lie ahead once hard-hit farmers receive government downsizing incentives.

The hog inventory on Canadian farmers fell 7.3 percent between the third quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.

Canadian hog farmers have suffered for several years from a crushing combination of low prices, high feed costs and a volatile Canadian dollar. Discovery of the H1N1 flu in an Alberta pig herd in April resulted in more than a dozen countries banning Canadian pork, although most have since restored imports.

Canada is one of the world&apos;s leading pork exporters.

&quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;re nearly as far down the downsizing road as we&apos;re going to get,&quot; said Neil Ketilson, general manager of Sask Pork, an organization of farmers in the western province of Saskatchewan. &quot;We&apos;ve had some relief on feed costs, but the price of hogs is terrible.&quot;

Farmers had 11.8 million hogs on their farms on Oct. 1, down from 12.7 million on the same date last year. The hog herd had been dropping at a 6.7 percent rate when Statscan last measured supplies on July 1.

Most damaging has been the United States country of origin food labelling law that has resulted in American meat packers reducing imports of hogs and cattle from Canada to avoid costs of segregating foreign from domestic supplies.

Hog farmers exported 1.6 million hogs during the third quarter, with year to date exports of 5 million head, down 31.5 percent from the same period in 2008. The U.S. is by far Canada&apos;s largest export market for livestock.

Lean hog futures LCc1 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which influence prices paid in Canada, have increased since August but are down 5.5 percent from a year ago at $54.85 per cwt early on Wednesday.

Money from a C$75 million ($70 million) fund that the Canadian government earmarked on Aug. 15 to encouraging hog farmers to close their barns for at least three years has not yet reached farmers. Farmers are required to bid the amount of money they would accept to idle their barns, with the first wave of bids opened Nov. 4.

Interest is running high in the funds to cease production, Ketilson said.

The inventory of pigs kept for breeding and number of farrowed sows have also fallen to at least five-year lows, Statscan said, which suggests the overall herd downsizing trend will continue.

Maple Leaf Foods (MFI.TO) and Olymel L.P., the two biggest hog processors in Canada, should see ample supplies in the short term as farmers slaughter their hogs and face reduced access to the U.S., Ketilson said. Domestic slaughter is up 5.9 percent in the third quarter, likely reflecting increased production by Olymel, he said.

In the longer term, supply could become a bigger concern for packers, who have lost money on hog processing of late, Ketilson said.

    <body>By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc (WLP.N) posted an 11 percent drop in profit as Americans losing their jobs also lost insurance coverage, but results crushed estimates on favorable medical costs, changes to its Medicare plans and shedding of unprofitable Medicaid contracts.

Still, WellPoint warned that it expected higher medical costs for the full year, owing in part to expenses tied to the flu and Cobra coverage for workers who lost their jobs.

It also forecast lower operating earnings next year, repeating its bearish view for 2010, although it put off giving details until early next year.

&quot;It&apos;s a good, solid bottom-line number in the quarter,&quot; Collins Stewart analyst Brian Wright said. &quot;Commentary for the rest of the year and pricing and cost trends seems a bit cautious from management.&quot;

Shares of WellPoint, the largest health insurer by membership, were 0.5 percent lower, but the decline was less than rivals on an overall down day for the stock market.

WellPoint&apos;s net income fell to $730.2 million, or $1.53 per share, from $820.7 million, or $1.60 per share, a year earlier. The latest results included a charge of 28 cents per share for impairment of intangible assets.

Excluding the charge and investment gains, the company earned $1.78 per share, well ahead of the analysts&apos; average estimate of $1.37, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue slipped 0.7 percent to $15.21 billion but was higher than the $15.15 billion expected by analysts.

WellPoint followed UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) in reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results while expressing caution about 2010.

Shares of health insurers are trading at historic lows over concerns that the healthcare overhaul under debate in Congress will dramatically undercut their business.

WellPoint executives said they want more clarity on reform, in particular a potential industry-wide fee of $6.7 billion, as well as the severity of the H1N1 swine flu season before providing Wall Street with a more detailed 2010 outlook.

&quot;There are a number of moving pieces right now, and we thought it wouldn&apos;t be really the right thing to do to come forward with guidance with all the caveats that we&apos;d be describing,&quot; WellPoint Chief Executive Officer Angela Braly said in an interview.

WellPoint reported enrollment of 33.9 million as of September 30, down 4.2 percent from a year earlier.

Operating profit in the consumer business more than doubled to $520 million. Results were bolstered by product changes in the company&apos;s Medicare business and withdrawal from unprofitable contracts in its Medicaid business.

Profit fell 31 percent to $628 million in its commercial unit serving employers, hurt by lower enrollment. Higher administrative costs, from an increase in compensation and spending for technology and customer service, hurt results.

Overall, WellPoint spent 81.1 percent of its premium revenue on medical costs, less than 82.5 percent a year earlier and lower than several analysts expected.

But it said medical costs would rise around 9 percent for 2009, plus or minus 0.5 percent, which is slightly higher than its prior view. One factor in the higher cost outlook is government information and internal pharmacy data show spiking flu trends, Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said.

The other is people using Cobra insurance, who in general tend to be higher users of medical services. DeVeydt said some Americans also may soon lose their Cobra coverage and decide to undergo elective surgery or use other services before they do.

Analysts expressed concern WellPoint may not have accounted for the higher medical costs for its already-resolved contracts for 2010, potentially hurting profits, but DeVeydt said the company was prepared.

&quot;We expect both of those to have a pretty significant impact in the fourth quarter, and we&apos;re pricing ahead for that,&quot; DeVeydt said in an interview.

The company backed its previous forecast for 2009 net income of $5.06 to $5.12 per share. Excluding investment losses and the impairment charge, WellPoint&apos;s forecast rose to a range of $5.86 to $5.92 per share, compared with $5.60 to $5.66 previously. Analysts looked for $5.67.

WellPoint shares were down 24 cents at $46.46 on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Tuesday, the stock had risen about 11 percent this year, compared with a 6.6 percent rise for the S&amp;P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government may end up throwing away unused doses of swine flu vaccine if people cannot get it soon enough, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.

Members of Congress questioned whether federal officials were too rosy in their estimates of how much vaccine would be available and when, and companies said they were still struggling to produce immunizations against H1N1.

CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said 22.4 million doses were now available to states, which can get them a day after they order them.

&quot;It&apos;s quite likely that that too little vaccine is one of the things that&apos;s making people more interested in getting vaccinated, frankly,&quot; Frieden told reporters.

&quot;We think it will get easier to find vaccine in the weeks that come.&quot;

&quot;We have passed on the manufacturing estimates, and as they have changed, we have conveyed the information to the American people, too.&quot;

Vaccine makers and government researchers alike have complained about the reliance on outdated and unpredictable vaccine manufacturing methods that use chicken eggs.

The virus has spread much faster than vaccine can be delivered, and Frieden estimates that millions of Americans have been infected. While not especially deadly, it is affecting young adults and children who normally escape the most serious consequences of seasonal flu.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government may end up throwing away unused doses of swine flu vaccine if people cannot get it soon enough, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.

Members of Congress questioned whether federal officials were too rosy in their estimates of how much vaccine would be available and when, and companies said they were still struggling to produce immunizations against H1N1.

CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said 22.4 million doses were now available to states, which can get them a day after they order them.

&quot;It&apos;s quite likely that that too little vaccine is one of the things that&apos;s making people more interested in getting vaccinated, frankly,&quot; Frieden told reporters.

&quot;We think it will get easier to find vaccine in the weeks that come.&quot;

Many states and cities say they have received about one-tenth as much vaccine as they originally had expected by this time. Frieden said the delays may discourage people who are lining up for vaccine.

&quot;It is likely also as we produce more vaccine and as both people are given the opportunity to get vaccinated, and as disease maybe wanes in the future, we will have significant amounts of vaccine that can&apos;t be used,&quot; Frieden said.

&quot;One of the messages for states, localities and health providers is not to reserve vaccine that they have available, to give it out as soon as it comes in, because more is on the way.&quot;

In September, U.S. officials said 40 million vaccine doses would be available by the end of October and they estimated 20 million doses a week would be delivered, with a goal of 250 million doses by the end of flu season in March or April.

UNRELIABLE ESTIMATES

Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins asked why the estimates were so far off.

&quot;It now appears that much of the vaccine could arrive only after many people have already been infected with H1N1,&quot; she said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, released late on Monday.

&quot;It seems that HHS gave its assurance of sufficient supply in August without adequate information to make such a commitment.&quot;

Connecticut independent Senator Joseph Lieberman weighed in

on Tuesday.

&quot;Unfortunately, these missteps in estimating available doses of H1N1 vaccine have effects beyond just growing public frustration; they have the potential to critically undermine our vaccine distribution efforts, which depend on accurate estimates of vaccine availability,&quot; he said.

But HHS spokeswoman Jenny Backus said the agency was simply passing on information as it became available.

&quot;We have been very clear and open and told the American people what we know when we know it,&quot; she said in a telephone interview.

&quot;We have passed on the manufacturing estimates, and as they have changed, we have conveyed the information to the American people, too.&quot;

Vaccine makers and government researchers alike have complained about the reliance on outdated and unpredictable vaccine manufacturing methods that use chicken eggs.

    <body>ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey&apos;s health minister urged Turks to avoid kissing or handshaking for the next five months to contain the spread of H1N1, newspapers said Tuesday, after Turkey reported its first known death from the flu virus.

Schools in Turkey&apos;s capital Ankara have been closed for a week after the ministry said a 29-year-old patient, treated for pneumonia, died during the weekend after developing sudden respiratory problems. The patient tested positive for swine flu.

    <body>* Microbix to build vaccine plant with Chinese company

* Capacity for 300 mln doses of pandemic flu vaccine

* Shares up 16 percent at 65 Canadian cents

(Adds details and company comments. In U.S. dollars)

TORONTO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Microbix Biosystems (MBX.TO), a small Canadian biotechnology company, said on Tuesday it would partner with a state-owned Chinese drugmaker to build Asia&apos;s largest flu vaccine plant.

The Toronto-based company said it formed a joint venture with Hunan Biopharmaceutical Co to build and operate the $200 million facility located near Changsha City.

The plant, the third-largest vaccine plant in the world, will have the capacity to produce more than 100 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine a year, and up to 300 million doses of a vaccine to prevent pandemic influenza, including the H1N1 flu virus, when it is fully operational by 2013. Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010.

&quot;We are addressing an unmet medical need in China,&quot; William Gastle, Microbix chairman and chief executive, told Reuters. &quot;China is one of those countries that does not have enough capacity to supply its domestic population with influenza vaccines.&quot;

The agreement comes as countries brace for another wave of the deadly swine flu and scramble for supplies of the vaccine as they step up their vaccination programs.

Gastle said the company is currently working with lenders to finalize the financial arrangements, but refused to comment on how the venture would be funded.

Microbix shares were up more than 16 percent at year-high of 65 Canadian cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange by late morning.

Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine for a national population of more than 33 million.

Experts predict that a third of the global population -- 2 billion people -- will eventually be infected with H1N1. Every year seasonal influenza infects between 5 percent and 20 percent of the population. ($1=$1.07 Canadian) (Reporting by Scott Anderson; Editing by Frank McGurty)</body>

* Shipbuilders tumble amid deepening shipping sector fears

* Blue chips in tech, auto sectors extend losses (Updates to mid-morning)

By Jungyoun Park

SEOUL, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Seoul shares declined on Wednesday as caution prevailed ahead of key earnings and economic data this week including results from Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), while losses by shipbuilders weighed heavily on markets.

Analysts said U.S. stock losses on Tuesday and foreign selling pressured markets, while worries about the H1N1 virus spreading rapidly, further hurt sentiment.

&quot;Markets reacted weakly to strong gross domestic product data and earnings, and it appears caution is prevailing at large, as global economies and financial markets are still seen in fragile shape,&quot; said Kim Seong-bong, a market analyst at Samsung Securities.

&quot;And recent news about influenza, which worsens fears about its seemingly accelerating spread, is an added negative. It could curtail holiday shopping in the United States, for instance, and dent fourth quarter earnings of retailers and manufacturers,&quot; Kim added.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was down 1.29 percent at 1,628.29 points as of 0140 GMT.

Foreign investors were sellers of a net 79 billion won ($66.41 million) worth of stocks, snapping a three-session consecutive buying streak, and institutions offloaded 70 billion won worth of shares.

Key technology and auto issues retreated, with Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), the world&apos;s No.1 memory chip maker, losing 1.48 percent and LG Electronics (066570.KS), an electronics giant, falling 3.81 percent.

Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), South Korea&apos;s No.1 automaker, shed 1.71 percent.

Shipbuilders also fell across the board amid worsening fears about the shipping industry, following a Financial Times report that leading German container shipper Peter Dohle Schiffahrts was seeking financial help from the German government.

&quot;Global shippers are in financial trouble, and signs of the industry&apos;s bottom are nowhere in sight,&quot; said Yeom Dong-eun, an analyst at IBK Securities.

&quot;We think the current downturn will likely continue through 2011...it looks like a long-term industry slowdown,&quot; Yeom added.

Shares in Hyundai Heavy Industries (009540.KS), the world&apos;s No.1 shipbuilder, fell 3.65 percent and Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering (042660.KS) declined 3.01 percent.

But shares in SK Chemicals (006120.KS) outperformed, advancing 1.35 percent, helped by a positive brokerage note and strengthening earnings expectations.

&quot;We expect SK Chemicals to post strong growth in its earnings for the third quarter, and momentum will continue into the fourth quarter&quot; with European approval of the SID-530 drug manufactured by the firm expected, Tong Yang Securities said in a note on Wednesday.

Tong Yang implied SK Chemicals shares could rise as high as 152,000 won, but &quot;conservatively&quot; maintained its price target at 119,000 won.

Elsewhere, South Korea&apos;s state-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) (036460.KS) lost 3 percent after the company said late on Tuesday its net loss for the third quarter widened from a year ago to 125.1 billion won.

    <body>Oct 27 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- Faced with the resurgence of the H1N1 influenza virus, Ottawa has fast-tracked a vaccination program for pregnant women, signalling an urgency to safeguard at-risk Canadians in the coming weeks.

- Federal political parties are scrambling to stake out turf in the debate over the retirement savings crisis, with the opposition Liberals vowing they&apos;d take a more activist role than the Harper government and Conservatives warning against costly new schemes.

BUSINESS:

- When Statistics Canada releases its monthly report on employment insurance tomorrow, notable will be the lack of information on the number of unemployed who have exhausted their Employment Insurance benefits.

This is frustrating the efforts of economists and also complicating public policy, because how can governments and support agencies respond if the full extent of the problem is unknown?

- Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, a former international investment banker, is taking aim at his former counterparts on Wall Street and in the City of London.

In remarkably forceful comments Monday, Carney suggested bankers in the United States and Europe are suffering from hubris, have lost sight of their proper role in the economy, and can&apos;t be trusted to operate in the best interests of the financial system.

- When Michael Eisner left Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) four years ago, no less than the nephew of Walt Disney himself questioned whether the departing executive had run out of ideas.

Now Rogers Communications Inc (RCIb.TO) is betting millions of dollars that the former golden boy of the U.S. entertainment industry, who revitalized Disney in the 1980s and 1990s with titles such as The Lion King and The Little Mermaid, still has a few grand visions left in him.

NATIONAL POST:

- New York&apos;s mandate that fast-food restaurants post calorie information on their menus has changed consumer habits, the city said on Monday, contradicting a recent independent study showing no effect.

- A branch of Toronto&apos;s renowned Hospital for Sick Children is being criticized for funding an autism conference whose organizers champion the discredited belief that childhood immunization causes the neurological disorder.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Volatility came back to haunt North American equity markets Monday, sending stocks tumbling after an early morning surge as investors, who have been dithering over further gains for days, took confusion over the U.S. homebuyer tax credit as excuse to sell and lock in profits.

- Oil fell more than 2 percent to below $79 a barrel Monday on concerns that a sluggish economic recovery will keep fuel demand low.</body>

    <title>BUY OR SELL: Can Estee Lauder rise more after upbeat view?</title>

    <summary>... Or are consumers keeping a lid on spending heading into the winter? Could fears over the H1N1 flu virus put more pressure on sales? ROSY VIEW. ...</summary>
    <body>By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc&apos;s (EL.N) recent upbeat forecast could be much more than cosmetic.

Estee Lauder is due to report financial results on Friday and has already pleased investors by saying its first-quarter profit will be significantly higher than thought.

The cosmetics maker also plans to raise its 2010 forecast when it reports earnings, although it has a cautious take on economic recovery and consumer spending.

Some of the upside came from its sales at duty-free shops, growth in Asia and strong interest in new products after a year of consumer belt-tightening. But tight cost controls and the improved foreign currency translation also helped, while holiday season orders arrived a quarter earlier than anticipated.

Estee Lauder shares have risen about 6 percent since it issued its positive assessment on October 16. The company has a higher price-to-earnings ratio than other cosmetics makers such as Avon Products Inc (AVP.N) and Elizabeth Arden Inc (RDEN.O).

Will an uptick in travel and early holiday demand spell relief? Or are consumers keeping a lid on spending heading into the winter? Could fears over the H1N1 flu virus put more pressure on sales?

ROSY VIEW

&quot;The environment&apos;s only still getting better, especially with the continued weakness in the dollar. That&apos;s helping them even further,&quot; said Wedbush Morgan analyst Rommel Dionisio.

&quot;Retailers have really narrowed the number of SKUs (specific items) and vendors that provide prestige cosmetics and fragrances in the sector and so the bigger stalwart companies like an Estee Lauder certainly benefit from that reduced competition.&quot;

Dionisio, who rates Estee Lauder &quot;outperform,&quot; raised his price target by $5 to $48 after the October 16 announcement.

He said destination travel has come back a little bit, which helps Estee Lauder and other cosmetics makers that derive a good chunk of their profits from duty-free shops.

&quot;I wouldn&apos;t say the retail environment is robust yet, certainly. There&apos;s still room for improvement there ... They&apos;ve done well even despite the environment not even being that particularly robust yet.&quot;

TOO EARLY TO SHINE

In August, Estee Lauder forecast fiscal-year earnings of $1.55 to $1.70 per share. Analysts are now calling for a profit of $1.79, up 10 cents since the company&apos;s preview.

Bill Pecoriello, chief executive of Consumer Edge Research, said Estee Lauder could raise its forecast by about 10 cents to 15 cents per share, as foreign currency translation could add about 10 cents this year. He said travel retail shipments likely added about 5 cents to 6 cents to the first quarter.

&quot;Whether they go up beyond that on the full year is how they feel about the underlying business,&quot; he said.

&quot;We think with the valuation right now, the market&apos;s baking in a lot more than 10 to 15 cents,&quot; said Pecoriello, who has a &quot;neutral&quot; rating on Estee Lauder.

Pecoriello prefers Avon in the cosmetics space. He expects organic sales to rise 6 percent to 7 percent over the next couple of quarters at Avon and projects 3 percent growth in such sales at Estee Lauder.

&quot;Avon is a play on more value beauty, not high end beauty in the department store channel, which is struggling. So that&apos;s our preferred name in beauty right now.&quot;

By Susan Kelly

CHICAGO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Hospital products and generic drugmaker Hospira Inc (HSP.N) on Tuesday said quarterly net earnings rose 42 percent, fueled by a new product launch, and it raised its full-year profit forecast.

Earnings excluding items beat analysts&apos; average forecast by 21 cents a share due to unexpectedly strong demand for the company&apos;s newly launched generic colon cancer treatment.

Hospira shares rose $1.07, or 2.31 percent, to $47.37, reflecting expectations that demand for the new drug will taper off going forward, analysts said.

Third-quarter net income was $116.2 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with $81.8 million, or 51 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding special items, Hospira said it earned 90 cents a share.

Analysts had expected a profit of 69 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Net sales rose about 9 percent to $1.01 billion in the quarter, boosted by the U.S. launch of generic oxaliplatin solution to treat colon cancer.

&quot;Within pharmaceuticals, we suspect that inventory build associated with the launch of generic oxaliplatin (eloxatin) contributed almost all of the upside relative to our forecasts,&quot; Goldman Sachs analyst David Roman said in a note to clients.

Global pharmaceutical sales rose 14.3 percent, driven by specialty injectables, while sales of medical devices fell 3.4 percent due to reduced spending by hospitals in the recession.

Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira said it continues to expect net sales for the year to rise about 5 percent to 7 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translations, and to be up slightly including foreign exchange.

The company said it now expects full-year adjusted 2009 earnings of between $2.85 and $2.90 a share, up from the previous outlook of $2.80 to $2.85 a share.

Analysts said the forecast looked conservative, with the sales outlook unchanged.

&quot;Given the fact that the company only raised full-year guidance by $0.05, despite the $0.21 beat in the quarter, suggests to us that one-time inventory stocking was the key driver of upside in the quarter,&quot; Roman wrote.

Company executives on a conference call said customers accelerated purchases of oxaliplatin in the third quarter, and that exceptionally strong demand was expected to slow in the fourth quarter.

The company&apos;s full-year outlook also reflects expectations that hospital budgets with remain constrained and delays in production of the H1N1 vaccine, executives said. Hospira does not make the vaccine, but can package it into syringes. (Reporting by Susan Kelly, editing by Maureen Bavdek)</body>

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Canada has secured 200,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine from Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), a move that will allow earlier than planned vaccination of pregnant women, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said on Monday.

The vaccine contains no adjuvant, a natural product that allows for more effective use of vaccine supplies, and is the type recommended for pregnant women.

Vaccination with the new vaccine should begin next week, said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer.

Pregnant women are one of the groups deemed most vulnerable to H1N1 flu, but vaccine without adjuvant was not available as quickly as the vaccine for the general population. That meant pregnant women had to wait while a national immunization effort got 536870913 544566884

&quot;We have heard the concerns from pregnant women about having to wait for unadjuvanted vaccine,&quot; Aglukkaq said in a news conference in Ottawa. &quot;We felt that given the increase in cases of H1N1 flu virus across the country, it was prudent to offer pregnant women earlier access to the unadjuvanted vaccine.&quot;

More Canadians are getting sick with the H1N1 flu, the minister said, but she gave no updated figures on deaths and hospitalizations.

CSL&apos;s unadjuvanted vaccine has also been approved for use in Australia and the United States.

The vaccine from CSL should be enough to vaccinate all pregnant Canadian women who ask for it, Butler-Jones said. Canada has also ordered 1.8 million doses of H1N1 vaccine for pregnant women from GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK.L), but that vaccine won&apos;t be ready as quickly.

Canada&apos;s health department gave final approval last week to a vaccine with adjuvant produced by GlaxoSmithKline for most of the population, allowing the governments of its provinces to proceed with vaccinations.

Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine for a national population of more than 33 million.

The federal government has not decided whether to share any surplus vaccine with other countries.

&quot;It all depends on how many Canadians go out and get the vaccine,&quot; Aglukkaq said. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to say how much extra we might have.&quot; (Reporting by Rod Nickel; editing by Peter Galloway)</body>

&quot;We have heard the concerns from pregnant women about having to wait for unadjuvanted vaccine,&quot; Aglukkaq said in a news conference in Ottawa. &quot;We felt that given the increase in cases of H1N1 flu virus across the country, it was prudent to offer pregnant women earlier access to the unadjuvanted vaccine.&quot;

More Canadians are getting sick with the H1N1 flu, the minister said, but she gave no updated figures on deaths and hospitalizations.

CSL&apos;s unadjuvanted vaccine has also been approved for use in Australia and the United States.

The vaccine from CSL should be enough to vaccinate all pregnant Canadian women who ask for it, Butler-Jones said. Canada has also ordered 1.8 million doses of H1N1 vaccine for pregnant women from GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK.L), but that vaccine won&apos;t be ready as quickly.

Canada&apos;s health department gave final approval last week to a vaccine with adjuvant produced by GlaxoSmithKline for most of the population, allowing the governments of its provinces to proceed with vaccinations.

Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine for a national population of more than 33 million.

The federal government has not decided whether to share any surplus vaccine with other countries.

&quot;It all depends on how many Canadians go out and get the vaccine,&quot; Aglukkaq said. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to say how much extra we might have.&quot; (Reporting by Rod Nickel; editing by Peter Galloway)</body>

    <body>WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Despite long lines and limited supplies of the H1N1 flu vaccine, U.S. efforts against the disease are not too late, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Monday.

Sebelius acknowledged frustrating waits to get the vaccine, but said some 16.5 million doses are now being made available, with efforts to get more.

&quot;I never like to see people inconvenienced,&quot; Sebelius said on ABC&apos;s &quot;Good Morning America. &quot;If we had found the virus a little earlier, we could have started a little earlier.&quot;

Asked whether this effort might be too late in light of one estimate that the H1N1 flu virus will peak by October 31, Sebelius said, &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too late ... What we saw in 1950s (flu pandemic) was that there was a big outbreak in fall and then a new wave in the spring.&quot;

With a future wave of H1N1 possible, vaccination is still useful, Sebelius said.

She acknowledged that four out of five sources of the vaccine are outside the United States, but said an additional U.S. plant will be making the vaccine in 2010.

&quot;Certainly it&apos;s a concern that we rely on other nations to purchase the vaccine,&quot; Sebelius said.

In response to a question about whether the United States should have taken more aggressive measures earlier, Sebelius told NBC&apos;s &quot;Today&quot; program that it was unclear early on just how deadly this virus would be.

She noted that 1,000 people have died from this disease in the United States but added, &quot;This is not presenting in most people to be a seriously lethal disease.&quot;

Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, speaking on CNN, advised healthy adults over 25 and senior citizens to wait and allow more vulnerable patients -- children, young adults, healthcare workers, pregnant women, adults with chronic conditions and parents and others who take care of infants -- to receive the vaccine first.

President Barack Obama has declared 2009 H1N1 swine flu a national emergency which the White House said will make it easier for U.S. medical facilities to handle a surge in flu patients by allowing the waiver of some requirements of Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs as needed.

    <body>BEIJING, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech Ltd SVA.A said on Tuesday that it had received an additional order for 5.19 million doses of its H1N1 influenza vaccine from the Chinese government.

Sinovac said in a statement it was required to produce the new batch of the Panflu.1 vaccine for the central government by Dec. 12.

The company added that it had already completed production of its first batch of 6.3 million doses.

Sinovac was the first company worldwide to complete clinical trials for a vaccine to treat the new H1N1 strain, commonly known as swine flu. [ID:nLI544899]

China has to date reported 35,664 H1N1 infections, including three deaths.

Health Minister Chen Zhu warned last month that China faced a grim situation in containing the disease as schools started up again and the number of cases rose. [ID:nPEK102128]

Sinovac said in September that its vaccine protected patients with a single dose. [ID:nPEK368343] (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Chris Lewis)</body>

The vaccine contains no adjuvant, a natural product that allows for more effective use of vaccine supplies, and is the type recommended for pregnant women.

    <body>* Adjusted Q3 profit beats analysts&apos; consensus by 21 cents

By Susan Kelly

CHICAGO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Hospital products and generic drugmaker Hospira Inc (HSP.N) on Tuesday said quarterly net earnings rose 42 percent, fueled by a new product launch, and it raised its full-year profit forecast.

Earnings excluding items beat analysts&apos; average forecast by 21 cents a share due to unexpectedly strong demand for the company&apos;s newly launched generic colon cancer treatment.

Hospira shares rose $1.07, or 2.31 percent, to $47.37, reflecting expectations that demand for the new drug will taper off going forward, analysts said.

Third-quarter net income was $116.2 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with $81.8 million, or 51 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding special items, Hospira said it earned 90 cents a share.

Analysts had expected a profit of 69 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Net sales rose about 9 percent to $1.01 billion in the quarter, boosted by the U.S. launch of generic oxaliplatin solution to treat colon cancer.

&quot;Within pharmaceuticals, we suspect that inventory build associated with the launch of generic oxaliplatin (eloxatin) contributed almost all of the upside relative to our forecasts,&quot; Goldman Sachs analyst David Roman said in a note to clients.

Global pharmaceutical sales rose 14.3 percent, driven by specialty injectables, while sales of medical devices fell 3.4 percent due to reduced spending by hospitals in the recession.

Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira said it continues to expect net sales for the year to rise about 5 percent to 7 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translations, and to be up slightly including foreign exchange.

The company said it now expects full-year adjusted 2009 earnings of between $2.85 and $2.90 a share, up from the previous outlook of $2.80 to $2.85 a share.

Analysts said the forecast looked conservative, with the sales outlook unchanged.

&quot;Given the fact that the company only raised full-year guidance by $0.05, despite the $0.21 beat in the quarter, suggests to us that one-time inventory stocking was the key driver of upside in the quarter,&quot; Roman wrote.

Company executives on a conference call said customers accelerated purchases of oxaliplatin in the third quarter, and that exceptionally strong demand was expected to slow in the fourth quarter.

The company&apos;s full-year outlook also reflects expectations that hospital budgets with remain constrained and delays in production of the H1N1 vaccine, executives said. Hospira does not make the vaccine, but can package it into syringes. (Reporting by Susan Kelly, editing by Maureen Bavdek)</body>

    <body>Oct 27 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- Faced with the resurgence of the H1N1 influenza virus, Ottawa has fast-tracked a vaccination program for pregnant women, signalling an urgency to safeguard at-risk Canadians in the coming weeks.

- Federal political parties are scrambling to stake out turf in the debate over the retirement savings crisis, with the opposition Liberals vowing they&apos;d take a more activist role than the Harper government and Conservatives warning against costly new schemes.

BUSINESS:

- When Statistics Canada releases its monthly report on employment insurance tomorrow, notable will be the lack of information on the number of unemployed who have exhausted their Employment Insurance benefits.

This is frustrating the efforts of economists and also complicating public policy, because how can governments and support agencies respond if the full extent of the problem is unknown?

- Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, a former international investment banker, is taking aim at his former counterparts on Wall Street and in the City of London.

In remarkably forceful comments Monday, Carney suggested bankers in the United States and Europe are suffering from hubris, have lost sight of their proper role in the economy, and can&apos;t be trusted to operate in the best interests of the financial system.

- When Michael Eisner left Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) four years ago, no less than the nephew of Walt Disney himself questioned whether the departing executive had run out of ideas.

Now Rogers Communications Inc (RCIb.TO) is betting millions of dollars that the former golden boy of the U.S. entertainment industry, who revitalized Disney in the 1980s and 1990s with titles such as The Lion King and The Little Mermaid, still has a few grand visions left in him.

NATIONAL POST:

- New York&apos;s mandate that fast-food restaurants post calorie information on their menus has changed consumer habits, the city said on Monday, contradicting a recent independent study showing no effect.

- A branch of Toronto&apos;s renowned Hospital for Sick Children is being criticized for funding an autism conference whose organizers champion the discredited belief that childhood immunization causes the neurological disorder.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Volatility came back to haunt North American equity markets Monday, sending stocks tumbling after an early morning surge as investors, who have been dithering over further gains for days, took confusion over the U.S. homebuyer tax credit as excuse to sell and lock in profits.

- Oil fell more than 2 percent to below $79 a barrel Monday on concerns that a sluggish economic recovery will keep fuel demand low.</body>

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Canada has secured 200,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine from Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), a move that will allow earlier than planned vaccination of pregnant women, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said on Monday.

Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, speaking on CNN, advised healthy adults over 25 and senior citizens to wait and allow more vulnerable patients -- children, young adults, healthcare workers, pregnant women, adults with chronic conditions and parents and others who take care of infants -- to receive the vaccine first.

President Barack Obama has declared 2009 H1N1 swine flu a national emergency which the White House said will make it easier for U.S. medical facilities to handle a surge in flu patients by allowing the waiver of some requirements of Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs as needed.

    <body>BEIJING, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech Ltd SVA.A said on Tuesday that it had received an additional order for 5.19 million doses of its H1N1 influenza vaccine from the Chinese government.

Sinovac said in a statement it was required to produce the new batch of the Panflu.1 vaccine for the central government by Dec. 12.

The company added that it had already completed production of its first batch of 6.3 million doses.

Sinovac was the first company worldwide to complete clinical trials for a vaccine to treat the new H1N1 strain, commonly known as swine flu. [ID:nLI544899]

China has to date reported 35,664 H1N1 infections, including three deaths.

Health Minister Chen Zhu warned last month that China faced a grim situation in containing the disease as schools started up again and the number of cases rose. [ID:nPEK102128]

Sinovac said in September that its vaccine protected patients with a single dose. [ID:nPEK368343] (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Chris Lewis)</body>

    <body>WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Canada has secured 200,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine from Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), allowing early vaccination of pregnant women, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said on Monday.

The vaccine contains no adjuvant, a natural product that allows for more effective use of vaccine supplies, and is the type recommended for pregnant women.

Vaccination with the new vaccine should begin next week, said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer.

The vaccine from CSL should be enough to vaccinate all Canadian pregnant women. Canada has also ordered 1.8 million doses of H1N1 vaccine for pregnant women from GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK.L) (Reporting by Rod Nickel; editing by Peter Galloway)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor - Analysis

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have approved emergency use of one experimental new antiviral drug against pandemic flu and researchers say several more in the pipeline may provide better ways to fight the virus.

Late on Friday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an authorization for peramivir, made by Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc and licensed to Shionogi &amp; Co Ltd.

The authorization allows the intravenous drug to be used in seriously ill patients who cannot take pills or inhale Relenza or when Tamiflu or Relenza do not seem to be helping.

So far, H1N1 swine flu seems mild enough so that most patients recover with no treatment, and those who get seriously ill are often helped by Tamiflu, Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc&apos;s popular pill.

But flu experts fully expect the virus will evolve resistance to Tamiflu, just as at least one strain of seasonal flu has. And it is spreading fast, ahead of efforts to get vaccines out, so drugs are vital for serious cases.

Some of the new drugs in the works could be used if and when that happens, and some hold better potential for using to protect people against the virus before they become infected.

They include Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd&apos;s CS 8958 or laninamivir and another drug called T-705 or favipiravir, made by Fujifilm Holdings Corp unit Toyama Chemical Co.

If these drugs could be readied and if they work as well as hoped, they can fill in during the months it takes to make flu vaccine -- especially if the H1N1 virus mutates and a new vaccine is needed or if some new strain of influenza emerges.

PROMISING FIELD

&quot;In general, I think that the field is looking much more promising than it has in some years and obviously this is in part due to the threats of H5N1 (avian influenza) and pandemic H1N1 disease,&quot; said Dr. Frederick Hayden of the University of Virginia and Britain&apos;s Wellcome Trust.

&quot;It&apos;s good there are alternative drugs and approaches, including combinations, that are being developed.&quot;

The few instances of Tamiflu-resistant swine flu viruses that have been seen all succumb to Relenza, GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s and Biota Inc&apos;s inhaled flu drug. But that could change, too -- the H1N1 virus is resistant to both of the older flu drugs known as amantadine and rimantadine.

Privately held NexBio Inc. has a drug in the works called FluDase, which the company hopes can overcome the problem of resistance. FluDase blocks the molecular doorways, or receptors, that flu viruses use to infect cells.

Because it works on the host -- the patient -- instead of on the virus, the company thinks resistance may not be a problem.

But researchers like Hayden say this also makes them cautious. &quot;That approach, although it is the most novel one, it is one that is going to take a bit longer in terms of getting the full safety data necessary to advance it,&quot; Hayden said in a telephone interview.

Officials at NexBio say the company is preparing to present studies in the coming weeks that will demonstrate that safety.

&quot;You could envision that it could be used in conjunction with other drugs once its own safety and efficacy have been clarified,&quot; Hayden said. &quot;I think combinations are the way to go.&quot;

Favipiravir is being tested in Japan and Hayden said the U.S. government is working to design good trials that could demonstrate how safe it is, perhaps among hospitalized flu patients this year.

LONG-ACTING DRUGS

Laninamivir, invented by Australia&apos;s Biota, is further along in testing. A phase III clinical trial result released in August showed a single inhaled dose worked as well as taking five days of Tamiflu pills.

It also appeared to be working slightly faster than Tamifu, which can reduce the severity of illness and cut about a day off recovery time.

Laninamivir is a long-acting neuraminadase inhibitor. It is in the same class of drugs as Relenza and Tamiflu but persists longer in the body.

Hayden said that means fewer doses can be taken and it might be possible to take a dose maybe once a week to prevent infection, an approach that would be used only for people at very high risk of infection such as healthcare workers or people with other diseases with an infected relative.

Tamiflu and Relenza can be used this way but global health experts do not recommend it except to protect the most vulnerable because of the fear the virus could become resistant more quickly with widespread use.

&quot;Biota also has something that they call FluNet,&quot; Hayden added. This drug is a longer-acting version of Relenza, known generically as zanamivir. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has given Biota $2.4 million, with a promise of up to $8.5 million, to develop this one.

In addition, Glaxo is developing an intravenous form of Relenza for the sickest patients.</body>

    <body>By Lucas Mearian - Computerworld

President Barack Obama declared the H1N1 flu outbreak a national emergency this past weekend, giving health-care systems the ability to bypass some federal regulatory requirements in order to quickly implement disaster plans should they become overwhelmed.

Similar to declaring a hurricane emergency as a storm approaches landfall, the national emergency declaration gives authority to health-care facilities to submit waivers to establish alternate care sites, and modified patient triage protocols, patient transfer procedures and other actions that occur when they fully implement disaster operations plans.

While the emergency declaration is targeted more at the government level, it should send up a red flag to the IT and business community, which is woefully unprepared from a technical and human resources standpoint to support employee absenteeism rates of 40% or more.

&quot;Organizations probably have not allocated enough resources for virtual private networks nor tested VPNs for the fact that 80% of their staff could be working from home,&quot; said Al Berman, executive director of the Disaster Recovery Institute , a New York-based business training and certification body. &quot;We ran some tests with companies and they ran out of TCP/IP addresses in five minutes.&quot;

Berman said much of the issue surrounds the cost of additional VPN bandwidth. For example, his organization met with representatives from large insurance provider recently who said it would cost $1 million to increase VPN bandwidth just to support 40% of their staff working from home.

According to FluView , a weekly influenza surveillance report prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) more than 1,000 people have died in the U.S. from swine flu, including more than 100 children, and 46 states reported widespread influenza activity. The U.S. government has created a Web site that offers guidance to businesses in case of a pandemic. Some simple measures include ensuring sick employees stay home.

&quot;If a corporation is seeing higher rates of absenteeism, they should send a very strong message to employees to stay home if they&apos;re sick. No one is that essential,&quot; said Kim Elliott, deputy director of the Trust for America&apos;s Health, a Washington-based nonprofit public health advocacy group.

&quot;If you don&apos;t pay employees for sick leave, you may want to rethink that policy. You don&apos;t want employees coming in and infecting others to the point where your business shuts down,&quot; she added.

Berman said he was recently in touch with a school system whose policy led to the failing of a student for three consecutive absences. &quot;The incubation period for the flu is three to five days, so they&apos;re encouraging kids to come to school and spread the flu,&quot; he said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the H1N1 flu outbreak a pandemic in June, elevating its health emergency alert status to level 6 -- its highest. At that time, influenza cases neared 30,000 worldwide. That number has leaped to 414,000 confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 this week with nearly 5,000 deaths reported to the WHO.

A Level 6 alert means that company officials have been asked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to undertake a number of efforts to fight any pandemic -- including the appointment of a workplace pandemic coordinator or team.

The coordinator would be responsible for monitoring employees to ensure they follow basic rules of hygiene, such as washing hands, and to make sure that breathing masks are available. And if a worker becomes sick, the pandemic monitor is supposed to ensure the worker goes home.

Elliott said businesses should project what effect a large number of concurrently sick employees may have on operations and put in place a plan to maintain critical operations.

&quot;That may mean cross training employees in some key business functions,&quot; Elliott said. &quot;For example, here, we&apos;ve cross-trained two employees to cut checks so we can still get paid in the case of an emergency.&quot;

Other key areas include maintaining IT infrastructure, basic bookkeeping and accounting, as well as customer-facing activities.

Businesses should also be in close contact with municipal agencies, rather than those at the state and federal level, because it will be the local government that determines if bus routes, schools, or even businesses need to be shut down, Berman said.

Berman said the U.S. government and businesses have also been lax in flu detection processes. For example, in Asian countries, Berman said travelers cannot leave an airport without having their temperatures taken.

&quot;You don&apos;t attend a meeting over there without having your temperature taken,&quot; he said. &quot;You come back to the states from being overseas and you&apos;re waiting in the custom&apos;s line and people are coughing and sneezing all over the place. We haven&apos;t done enough to stop the spread.&quot;

Berman said businesses need to consider the idea of &quot;social distancing&quot; or placing employees further apart physically, such as in cubicles, or asking nonessential staff to work from home if their resources support that.

But people should not overreact to the swine flu pandemic, Berman said, noting that most cases of the flu have been relatively mild. Any comparison to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 is unwarranted.

&quot;I think it&apos;s going to be a bad flu season, but it won&apos;t be a flu season where 50 million people die,&quot; Berman said.

* Says hurt by a severe flu season due to the H1N1 virus

* Shares drop as much as 6 pct (Adds analyst comment, share movement)

Oct 26 (Reuters) - Health insurer Amerigroup Corp (AGP.N) forecast third-quarter earnings below market estimates, citing higher medical costs tied to the onset of a severe flu season due to the H1N1 swine flu virus, and withdrew its full-year outlook.

The insurer&apos;s shares fell as much as 6 percent in early trade.

&quot;The bad news is that this marks the third shortfall in just a few months and comes only about a month after the last revision,&quot; Morgan Stanley analyst Doug Simpson wrote in a research note.

The company expects to earn 42 cents to 44 cents a share in the third quarter. Analysts expected the company to post a profit of 57 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

&quot;This EPS miss will push Amerigroup&apos;s 2009 margins to a new trough level. Whether margins stabilize at this level is difficult to know in advance since we&apos;re dealing with two unprecedented events - the recession and H1N1,&quot; Wells Fargo analyst Matt Perry said.

&quot;Nevertheless, we think that margins will recover, but likely not until second half of 2009.&quot;

Amerigroup, which has cut its full-year earnings outlook twice this year, withdrew its 2009 earnings-per-share earnings forecast of $2.55 to $2.75, saying it may not meet the view due to the wide range of medical cost outcomes that may occur in the fourth quarter.

&quot;The vast majority of our members are within the demographic most at risk for the flu and we appear to be early in the cycle,&quot; Chief Executive James Carlson said in a statement.

&quot;With this in mind, it is difficult to determine if, and when, the situation will abate, continue at current trends or worsen,&quot; Carlson added.

The company said medical costs incurred in the quarter will be above its expectations, due to a significant spike in flu-related activity that is most pronounced in September.

Shares of the company were down 3 percent at $21.97 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a low of $21.16 earlier. (Reporting by Archana Shankar, Shailesh Kuber in Bangalore; Editing by Ratul Ray Chaudhuri, Himani Sarkar)</body>

    <body>SEOUL, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of major South Korean newspapers on Tuesday prepared by Reuters in Seoul. Reuters has not checked the stories and does not guarantee their accuracy.

CHOSUN ILBO

South Korea&apos;s foreign minister Yu Myung-hwan said on Monday that the government planned to dispatch civilians to provincial reconstruction teams in Afghanistan as well as police and military forces to protect them.

According to the health ministry, an average of 4,200 people were infected with the H1N1 flu virus daily during the past week, three times more than the week before. Five people died of the disease on Monday.

A North Korean source said Monday that Kim Jong-un, the son of leader Kim Jong-il, visited in September the ninth army corps in Chongjin, North Korea&apos;s third largest city, to keep alert for possible uprisings within the unit, which is known to be involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.

MAEIL BUSINESS NEWSPAPER

Korea Resources Corporation said Monday that it had selected Samjong KPMG to advise on the sale of 5.5 percent of its stake in the Ambatovy nickel project in Madagascar to raise funds for possible acquisitions.

Hyundai (005380.KS) and Kia (000270.KS) Motors signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea Electric Power Corporation (015760.KS) on the development of electronic cars and chargers, which they aim to complete by August 2010.</body>

    <body>* Internet could get clogged during a pandemic

* SEC needs to make sure regulated companies have plans

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Securities exchanges have a sound network back-up if a severe pandemic keeps people home and clogging the Internet, but the Homeland Security Department has done little planning, Congressional investigators said on Monday.

The department does not even have a plan to start work on the issue, the General Accountability Office said.

But the Homeland Security Department accused the GAO of having unrealistic expectations of how the Internet could be managed if millions began to telework from home at the same time as bored or sick schoolchildren were playing online, sucking up valuable bandwidth.

Experts have for years pointed to the potential problem of Internet access during a severe pandemic, which would be a unique kind of emergency. It would be global, affecting many areas at once, and would last for weeks or months, unlike a disaster such as a hurricane or earthquake.

H1N1 swine flu has been declared a pandemic but is considered a moderate one. Health experts say a worse one -- or a worsening of this one -- could result in 40 percent absentee rates at work and school at any given time and closed offices, transportation links and other gathering places.

Many companies and government offices hope to keep operations going as much as possible with teleworking using the Internet. Among the many problems posed by this idea, however, is the issue of bandwidth -- especially the &quot;last mile&quot; between a user&apos;s home and central cable systems.

&quot;Such network congestion could prevent staff from broker-dealers and other securities market participants from teleworking during a pandemic,&quot; reads the GAO report, available here

&quot;The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for ensuring that critical telecommunications infrastructure is protected.&quot;

BLOCKING WEBSITES

Private Internet providers might need government authorization to block popular websites, it said, or to reduce residential transmission speeds to make way for commerce.

The Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Homeland Security, a group of private-sector firms and financial trade associations, has been working to ensure that trading could continue if big exchanges had to close because of the risk of disease transmission.

&quot;Because the key securities exchanges and clearing organizations generally use proprietary networks that bypass the public Internet, their ability to execute and process trades should not be affected by any congestion,&quot; the GAO report reads.

However, not all had good plans for critical activities if many of their employees were ill, the report reads.

Homeland Security had done even less, it said.

&quot;DHS has not developed a strategy to address potential Internet congestion,&quot; the report said.

It had also not even checked into whether the public or even other federal agencies would cooperate, GAO said.

&quot;The report gives the impression that there is potentially a single solution to Internet congestion that DHS could achieve if it were to develop an appropriate strategy,&quot; DHS&apos;s Jerald Levine retorted in a letter to the GAO.

&quot;An expectation of unlimited Internet access during a pandemic is not realistic,&quot; he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Securities exchanges have a sound network back-up if a severe pandemic keeps people home and clogging the Internet, but the Homeland Security Department has done little planning, Congressional investigators said on Monday.

The department does not even have a plan to start work on the issue, the General Accountability Office said.

But the Homeland Security Department accused the GAO of having unrealistic expectations of how the Internet could be managed if millions began to telework from home at the same time as bored or sick schoolchildren were playing online, sucking up valuable bandwidth.

Experts have for years pointed to the potential problem of Internet access during a severe pandemic, which would be a unique kind of emergency. It would be global, affecting many areas at once, and would last for weeks or months, unlike a disaster such as a hurricane or earthquake.

    <body>(Adds quote, details) SANTIAGO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Net profit at Chile&apos;s dominant
airline, LAN LAN.SNLFL.SN, tumbled 37 percent in the third
quarter compared with a year earlier on reduced traffic due to
the economic crisis and losses on fuel hedging. LAN&apos;s net profit totaled $52 million in the quarter
compared with a net profit of $83 million a year earlier. The company said its revenues tumbled 19 percent in the
quarter from a year earlier due to lower yields in passenger
and cargo traffic, which were partially offset by lower fuel
costs. Losses associated with fuel hedging totaled $14.4 million
in the quarter. &quot;In the weak global economic environment and despite the
impact of the H1N1 flu in the regional market, LAN continued to
show significant growth in its passenger operations,&quot; the
company said in a statement. In September, LAN said the worst of the economic crisis had
passed, but noted other influences, including the spread of
swine flu virus and rising fuel prices, could hurt profits. LAN&apos;s second-quarter profit fell 93 percent to $4.2
million. Chile&apos;s leading airline has affiliates in Ecuador, Peru and
Argentina. It accounts for more than half of Chile&apos;s
international passenger traffic and nearly three-quarters of
its domestic traffic.

    <body>Oct 26 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- The Harper government is looking at overhauling tax law to encourage bigger pension-fund surpluses, as part of a series of reforms to the country&apos;s crumbling pension regime to be introduced this fall.

- As the federal government and the provinces begin to roll out their mass vaccination campaign against H1N1 influenza this week, support for the inoculations among Canadians has plunged and the public is deeply divided about the need for the immunizations, according to a new survey.

- A 51-year-old Mississauga mother charged with killing her 15-year-old autistic son over the weekend will appear for a bail hearing in Brampton, Ontario, Monday.

The pair was staying at a local hotel Saturday night after a quarrel in the family home between the mother and her husband, who is the boy&apos;s father, police said.

BUSINESS:

- Canada&apos;s nine largest financial services companies have reached an agreement to give shareholders a vote next year on the same resolution approving the firms&apos; compensation policies for top executives.

- Starting this week, retail investors in Ontario and Quebec will be able to place highly leveraged bets on derivatives from the comfort of their living rooms using their home computers.

CMC Markets Canada, in a new service to be announced this week that took regulators three years to approve, will offer the investments through its online trading platform.

The products, commonly referred to as contracts for difference or CFDs, allow those who buy them to profit (or lose) from the price movements of things such as oil, currencies and stock indexes.

NATIONAL POST:

- The editor of a Punjabi newspaper was held at gunpoint by three masked men outside the newspaper&apos;s offices northwest of Toronto late Friday night, during an attack and attempted kidnapping that may have been sparked by the Sikh man&apos;s anti-extremist political views, the victim said.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney said Canadians should not underestimate the &quot;historic&quot; restructuring ahead for the economy as it needs to adapt to a reshaped global marketplace in the post-financial crisis era.</body>

    <body>By Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has declared 2009 H1N1 swine flu a national emergency, the White House said on Saturday.

The declaration will make it easier for U.S. medical facilities to handle a surge in flu patients by allowing the waiver of some requirements of Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs as needed, the White House said in a statement.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday that swine flu has become widespread in 46 of the 50 U.S. states, a level comparable to the peak of ordinary flu seasons but far earlier and with more waves of infection expected.

Obama signed the statement on Friday night.

The White House statement said the declaration was intended to prepare the country in case of &quot;a rapid increase in illness that may overburden health care resources.&quot; It was similar to disaster declarations issued before hurricanes hit coastal areas.

&quot;It&apos;s important to note that this is a proactive measure -- not a response to a new development,&quot; an administration official said.

&quot;H1N1 is moving rapidly, as expected. By the time regions or healthcare systems recognize they are becoming overburdened, they need to implement disaster plans quickly,&quot; he said.

Seasonal flu normally peaks sometime between late November and early March and kills about 36,000 Americans in an average year.

Swine flu has hit young adults and children the hardest, while seasonal flu normally is more dangerous for people over age 65.

H1N1, declared a public health emergency earlier in the year, has killed more than 1,000 people in the United States and put more than 20,000 in the hospital since it emerged earlier this year, the CDC said. But health officials are quick to note that the actual number of cases cannot be measured.

The new declaration clears the way for waivers of federal requirements that, for example, could prevent hospitals from establishing off-site, alternate care facilities that could help them deal with emergency department demands, the White House said.

The Health and Human Services Department is trying to deliver vaccines against H1N1 but says production is falling short of projections because companies are having trouble making them.

HHS has also moved to make available stockpiles of antiviral drugs oseltamivir, made by Roche AG under the brand name Tamiflu, and zanamivir, an inhaled drug made by GlaxoSmithKline under the brand name Relenza.

On Friday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for an experimental new drug called peramivir, made by Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc and licensed to Shionogi &amp; Co Ltd.

The authorization allows the intravenous drug to be used in hospitalized patients who cannot take pills or inhale Relenza or when Tamiflu or Relenza do not seem to be helping.

By Jungyoun Park

SEOUL, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Seoul shares reversed opening losses and turned up as stronger-than-expected gross domestic product data lifted sentiment, and gains in pharmaceutical issues such as Green Cross (006280.KS) fuelled rises.

Markets reacted positively to the economic data and foreign buyers helped spur the upward momentum, said Choi Seong-lak, a market analyst at SK Securities.

Foreign investors were buyers of Seoul stocks worth 121.1 billion won, and institutions turned net buyers after 12 consecutive sessions of selling.

&quot;Individual sectors that are positively impacted by related news flow, such as pharmaceuticals due to the U.S. declaration on swine flu, are fuelling gains,&quot; Choi added.

The Bank of Korea said the economy grew a seasonally adjusted 2.9 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, the fastest in 7-&amp;frac12; years and a third consecutive quarterly gain. [ID:nSEV002876]

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) rose 1.23 percent to 1,660.29 points as of 0150 GMT.

Shares in Green Cross jumped 14.73 percent helped by news the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted emergency use authorisation for the use of an experimental new drug called peramivir, made by Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc (BCRX.O) and licenced to Shionogi &amp; Co Ltd (4507.T). [ID:nN24139386]

Green Cross has the sole domestic licence to manufacture and distribute peramivir, the company spokesman confirmed.

Other pharmaceutical issues such as Ilyang Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (007570.KS) rose 5.21 percent.

Meanwhile, retail issues such as Lotte Shopping Co Ltd (023530.KS) rose 2.95 percent helped by positive domestic GDP data amid hopes consumption may be on a recovery track.

Shinsegae Co Ltd (004170.KS), South Korea&apos;s No.1 retailer by market value, was up 2.08 percent.

Elsewhere, shares in SK Energy (096770.KS) rose 2.56 percent after news South Korea&apos;s top crude refiner was chosen as a supplier of lithium-ion batteries for a hybrid electric vehicle project by Daimler (DAIGn.DE) unit Mitsubishi Fuso. [ID:nSEO13078]

&quot;The fact that SK Energy has succeeded in attracting a global automaker for its batteries proves that its auto battery technology is ready for commercial use,&quot; said Lim Ji-soo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.

But shares in Woori Finance Holdings (053000.KS) fell 1.18 percent, underperforming its peers, after a local media report that Korea Deposit Insurance Corp, a majority shareholder of Woori Finance, was considering selling part of its stake in the financial group in a block trade by mid-November.

&quot;Such plans have been known already, but the timing of the block deal has been mentioned in this report, and it has renewed overhang worries,&quot; said Hwang Huhn, an analyst at Woori Investment &amp; Securities.

&quot;Even if the sale is made over a block deal, shares will be sold at a discount,&quot; Hwang added. (Reporting by Jungyoun Park; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)</body>

    <body>By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health officials are struggling to deliver vaccine against the H1N1 pandemic virus ahead of its spread but Sanofi Pasteur, one of five vaccine makers under contract, said on Friday it was on track.

A spokeswoman said the company could now deliver 75.3 million doses of bulk vaccine ingredients by December.

&quot;Our shipments are tracking close to what we have agreed to with (the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). Thus far we have provided more vaccine to HHS than all other manufacturers combined,&quot; Sanofi, the vaccine unit of Sanofi-Aventis SA, said in a statement.

Sanofi said it has shipped 12 million of the 16.1 million vaccine doses the U.S. government had received as of Friday.

&quot;We have orders for 75.3 million doses of bulk antigen for anticipated delivery between October and December. We are on track to deliver this by December,&quot; the statement said.

HHS has also ordered vaccine from CSL Ltd, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune unit.

U.S. health officials recently trimmed supply expectations for H1N1 swine flu vaccine by 25-30 percent for October, saying manufacturers had run into production problems.

The delay has caused vaccine shortages at U.S. immunization clinics at a time when H1N1 flu activity has become widespread in 46 states.

Much of the available vaccine has been MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray, which contains live virus and is not recommended for some people at risk, including children under 2, pregnant women and children and adults over 50.

Companies are using decades-old technology used to make seasonal influenza vaccine to manufacture the H1N1 immunizations, but this involves uncertain methods that start with growing the virus in chicken eggs. For some reason H1N1 did not always grow well.

MedImmune had no problems but the other companies did.

Sanofi said it had taken steps to address the problem.

&quot;We are pleased to report that yields are now exceeding the yield projections used in early production planning with HHS,&quot; the statement said.

&quot;In fact, current yields are now close to our seasonal standard. Thus, we do not anticipate the strain yield to be a factor impacting future production schedules.&quot;

Sanofi said it was able to accelerate licensing for two new production lines with assistance from HHS and the Food and Drug Administration.

&quot;It must be recognized that we are producing a biological product and there is always an element of uncertainty with regard to production schedules,&quot; the statement said.

&quot;However, at this time we are tracking close to what we have agreed to ship and feel that we are well-positioned based on long standing experience in influenza production to continue to fulfill our agreements with HHS.&quot;

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday that swine flu has become widespread in 46 of the 50 U.S. states, a level comparable to the peak of ordinary flu seasons but far earlier and with more waves of infection expected.

Obama signed the statement on Friday night.

The White House statement said the declaration was intended to prepare the country in case of &quot;a rapid increase in illness that may overburden health care resources.&quot; It was similar to disaster declarations issued before hurricanes hit coastal areas.

&quot;It&apos;s important to note that this is a proactive measure -- not a response to a new development,&quot; an administration official said.

&quot;H1N1 is moving rapidly, as expected. By the time regions or healthcare systems recognize they are becoming overburdened, they need to implement disaster plans quickly,&quot; he said.

Seasonal flu normally peaks sometime between late November and early March and kills about 36,000 Americans in an average year.

Swine flu has hit young adults and children the hardest, while seasonal flu normally is more dangerous for people over age 65.

H1N1, declared a public health emergency earlier in the year, has killed more than 1,000 people in the United States and put more than 20,000 in the hospital since it emerged earlier this year, the CDC said. But health officials are quick to note that the actual number of cases cannot be measured.

The new declaration clears the way for waivers of federal requirements that, for example, could prevent hospitals from establishing off-site, alternate care facilities that could help them deal with emergency department demands, the White House said.

The Health and Human Services Department is trying to deliver vaccines against H1N1 but says production is falling short of projections because companies are having trouble making them.

HHS has also moved to make available stockpiles of antiviral drugs oseltamivir, made by Roche AG (ROG.VX) under the brand name Tamiflu, and zanamivir, an inhaled drug made by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) under the brand name Relenza.

On Friday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for an experimental new drug called peramivir, made by Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc (BCRX.O) and licensed to Shionogi &amp; Co Ltd (4507.T).

The authorization allows the intravenous drug to be used in hospitalized patients who cannot take pills or inhale Relenza or when Tamiflu or Relenza do not seem to be helping. (Additional reporting by Maggie Fox, editing by Eric Beech and Mohammad Zargham)</body>

    <body>By Yoko Nishikawa

HUA HIN, Thailand (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama will pitch his idea of an East Asian Community, inspired by the example of the European Union, when he meets his Asian counterparts this weekend.

Asian leaders are in Thailand for the &quot;East Asia Summit,&quot; bringing together the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.

WHY IS JAPAN PUSHING THE IDEA NOW?

Hatoyama, who took office last month after a landslide election victory, wants to put greater emphasis on Japan&apos;s ties with Asia while steering a diplomatic course more independent of the United States, Japan&apos;s most important security ally.

As its economic might declines as the population ages, Japan needs Asia&apos;s growing economic power for future growth.

Some analysts say Tokyo wants to draw China into regional arrangements as it fears losing its first-class status in the region amid talk of a &quot;G2&quot; arrangement under which Washington and Beijing shape the global economy. Economists expect China to replace Japan as the world&apos;s No.2 economy, possibly next year.

WHY DOES IT MATTER?

Intra-regional trade among member states of the East Asia Summit has grown three-fold over the past decade and accounts for 54 percent of their total trade, higher than that of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

The GDP of East Asia Summit members combined now accounts for around 23 percent of the world&apos;s total output.

In addition to increasing economic interdependence, Asia has many issues to tackle together, including the financial crisis, outbreaks of H1N1 flu, climate change and natural disasters.

IS THE IDEA NEW?

Not really. The idea of a regional Asian grouping is the brainchild of former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad, who proposed an East Asian Economic Caucus in 1990 -- a notion that some pundits called the caucus without the Caucasians.

Japan&apos;s push to create a home-grown Asian Monetary Fund to help troubled Asian economies in 1997 was quashed by the United States, just like Mahathir&apos;s EAEC proposal.

The East Asia Summit started in 2005, building on leaders&apos; meetings held since 1997 by ASEAN plus China, Japan and South Korea. But the group is struggling to forge a strong identity.

WHO WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE EAST ASIA COMMUNITY?

Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada has envisaged opening membership to Japan, China, South Korea, ASEAN, Australia, New Zealand, and India -- the same members as the East Asia Summit.

But he has recently toned down his comments, saying there is no immediate need for concrete details, and has tried to soothe worries in Washington about the United States being excluded.

WILL IT EVER FLY?

Critics say the regional concept is pie-in-the-sky, but some argue that with Japan&apos;s new push, the idea could gain momentum.

Tokyo acknowledges that it will take decades to boost political integration and create a common currency in a politically, culturally and economically diverse region.

Japan hopes to first deepen economic ties and then take a step-by-step approach to boosting cooperation in other areas such as the environment, energy and influenza. It says sharing a common vision for the regional community will help Asia overcome friction more easily. But Japan&apos;s Okada has said it is hard at the moment to envisage a security agreement like NATO in Asia.

To make it viable, Tokyo needs to build trust with Beijing, given China&apos;s bitter memories of Japan&apos;s wartime occupation, the economic competition between the two and mutual mistrust over their militaries.

Rivalry over who would take the leading role as well as how to define the U.S. role in the scheme could become hurdles.

Washington has been wary about fresh talk on Asia&apos;s regional bloc, but Tokyo says it is a long-term vision and the U.S.-Japan alliance remains the foundation of Japan&apos;s diplomacy.

ANY IMPACT ON DOLLAR&apos;S ROLE AS KEY CURRENCY?

Hatoyama has said his vision for an East Asian Community with a future goal of creating a common currency was not meant to diminish the role of the dollar, but market concerns linger.

The idea has always been touchy within Asia. Asian finance ministers a few years ago studied ways to create regional currency units as indicators to better monitor their currency movements, but the debate stirred controversy in some countries.

    <body>LONDON (Reuters) - Europe&apos;s drugs watchdog said on Friday that giving two doses of swine flu vaccine was preferable, even though many governments are pushing ahead with single-shot immunization for most people.

One dose of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s Pandemrix and Novartis&apos;s Focetria may be sufficient in adults, but the data so far is not conclusive, the European Medicines Agency said.

After reviewing the latest findings, the agency&apos;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) said it continued to recommend that H1N1 vaccines be preferably used as two doses, at least three weeks apart.

&quot;The CHMP noted that the data supplied to date are still limited and do not allow the committee to recommend the general use of a single-dose vaccination schedule,&quot; the London-based agency said in a statement.

The European Medicines Agency has so far approved three H1N1 vaccines -- Pandemrix, Focetria and Baxter International&apos;s Celvapan -- and others may be added later.

Initially experts thought two doses of vaccine would be needed for everybody because of the current H1N1 swine flu virus is a new strain. But in the past couple of months various clinical trials have suggested one dose may suffice.

As a result, many governments are now planning to give adults a single shot -- thereby stretching supplies and cutting costs.

In Britain, for example, where Pandemrix and Celvapan have been ordered, all those over 10 years of age receiving Glaxo&apos;s vaccine will get a single shot, but children will have two doses, as will everybody on Celvapan.

LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Europe&apos;s drugs watchdog said on Friday that giving two doses of swine flu vaccine was preferable, even though many governments are pushing ahead with single-shot immunisation for most people.

One dose of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) Pandemrix and Novartis&apos;s (NOVN.VX) Focetria may be sufficient in adults, but the data so far is not conclusive, the European Medicines Agency said.

    <body>* Pandemic hits peak comparable to seasonal winter flu

* 1,000 killed in U.S., 20,000 hospitalized

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - H1N1 swine flu has become widespread in 46 of the 50 U.S. states, a level comparable to the peak of ordinary flu seasons but far earlier and with more waves of infection expected, a top U.S. health official said on Friday.

&quot;Forty-six states having widespread transmission is the peak of flu season. To be basically in the peak of flu season in October is extremely unusual,&quot; said Dr Thomas Frieden, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Frieden said seasonal flu normally peaks sometime between late November and early March. And he noted that this virus was sickening young adults and children as opposed to seasonal flu, which usually hits people over 65 the hardest.

&quot;We expect that influenza will occur in waves and we can&apos;t predict how high, how far or how long the wave will go or when the next will come,&quot; he told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Swine flu has killed more than 1,000 Americans and put more than 20,000 in the hospital in the United States since it emerged earlier this year, Frieden said.

But health officials are quick to note that the actual number of cases cannot be measured. &quot;We have had up until now many millions of cases of pandemic influenza in the U.S. and the numbers continue to increase,&quot; Frieden said.

In a separate statement on Friday, the World Health Organization reported more than 414,000 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 worldwide, with nearly 5,000 deaths.

But the Geneva-based health agency noted that the figures were only the tip of the iceberg.

&quot;As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred,&quot; WHO said.

Frieden said swine flu manufacturers have produced 16.1 million doses of vaccine, and as of Wednesday, 11.3 million doses had been shipped to U.S. states.

The U.S. government initially expected to have 40 million doses of vaccine available by the end of October but last week cut that projection by 25 to 30 percent, saying production problems would limit the October supply to 28 million to 30 million doses.

&quot;Vaccine production is much less predictable than we wish. We are nowhere near where we thought we&apos;d be by now. We are not near where the vaccine manufacturers predicted we would be,&quot; Frieden said.

Much of the vaccine currently available is a nasal spray from AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) unit MedImmune.

The Obama administration has ordered vaccine from five manufacturers: Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune. (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Maggie Fox and Eric Beech)</body>

Frieden said swine flu manufacturers have produced 16.1 million doses of vaccine, and as of Wednesday, 11.3 million doses had been shipped to U.S. states.

The U.S. government initially expected to have 40 million doses of vaccine available by the end of October but last week cut that projection by 25 to 30 percent, saying production problems would limit the October supply to 28 million to 30 million doses.

&quot;Vaccine production is much less predictable than we wish. We are nowhere near where we thought we&apos;d be by now. We are not near where the vaccine manufacturers predicted we would be,&quot; Frieden said.

Much of the vaccine currently available is a nasal spray from AstraZeneca&apos;s unit MedImmune.

The Obama administration has ordered vaccine from five manufacturers: Sanofi-Aventis SA, CSL Ltd, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune.

    <body>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain&apos;s GlaxoSmithKline has shown that its H1N1 vaccine works in children after just one dose, potentially helping to ease the supply pressure as drugmakers rush to produce enough of the swine flu shot.

The vaccine, Pandemrix, is currently approved for use in two doses to children, but Glaxo said on Friday that governments might be able to change this to just one once the trial was completed.

Glaxo, the world&apos;s second biggest drugmaker, also said that 150,000 people have received the vaccine so far across Europe since mass vaccinations started last week.

Early results from the study showed that the vaccine worked after just one shot in all of the 200 children, aged between 6 and 36 months, that it tested.

Glaxo&apos;s Pandemrix has an edge over rival products because it contains a so-called adjuvant -- an immune-stimulating compound designed to increase the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Earlier on Friday, Europe&apos;s drugs watchdog, the European Medicines Agency, said that giving two doses of swine flu vaccine was preferable as the data so far was not conclusive.

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen - Analysis

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Healthcare companies are reaping the benefits of a global swine flu pandemic, brightening what might otherwise have been a dismal third quarter and bringing new focus on the market for vaccines.

Large European pharmaceutical companies are reporting windfall sales from flu drugs and H1N1 vaccines.

Small biotechs are winning fresh attention from investors and governments looking for quick, less expensive ways of making flu vaccines to protect their populations. And diagnostic companies have been growing revenues as doctors order more flu tests.

&quot;Pretty much everyone who does something in influenza in has gained from it,&quot; said Hedwig Kresse, an infectious diseases analyst at Datamonitor in London.

&quot;From a sales perspective, the big players certainly will see a very significant windfall of this pandemic this year,&quot; Kresse said in a telephone interview.

Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG said this week it expects the H1N1 flu vaccine to contribute about $400 million to $700 million of sales in the fourth quarter.

Vaccine makers GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Sanofi-Aventis SA and AstraZeneca Plc are all expected to get a lift from swine flu-related sales when they report fourth-quarter results next week.

Roche Holding AG last week raised its full-year estimates on higher sales of its flu drug Tamiflu, which also lifted forecasts at U.S. biotech Gilead Sciences Inc, which collects royalties on the pills.

Baxter International Inc, which makes a cell culture-based flu vaccine, expects as much as $40 million in H1N1 vaccine sales in the fourth quarter.

David Kagi, a healthcare analyst at Swiss-based Bank Sarasin &amp; Co estimates pandemic vaccine sales will be worth a total of $7.6 billion, even with a mild pandemic. A severe pandemic would result in total vaccine sales of $18 billion.

But both Kagi and Kresse said the pandemic effect would more likely be a blip than a lasting boost to sales. &quot;It will last this year, and if they are very lucky, it will last next year also,&quot; Kresse said.

U.S. PHARMA ON SIDELINES?

With the exception of Baxter and Gilead, most other U.S.-based pharmaceutical makers have not benefited much directly from the swine flu bonanza, but a round of acquisition activity last month suggests U.S. big pharma may not be happy sitting on the sidelines.

Johnson &amp; Johnson spent $444 million to buy a stake in Dutch biotech Crucell NV as part of a new push into influenza vaccine and drug development.

Abbott Laboratories Inc spent $6.6 billion on the drugs unit of Belgium&apos;s Solvay SA, including Solvay&apos;s Dutch cell-based flu vaccine production facility.

And Merck &amp; Co Inc, already a vaccine powerhouse with its shingles and cervical cancer vaccines, got back into the U.S. flu market with a deal to distribute seasonal flu vaccine made by Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd.

&quot;I think it&apos;s certainly a big driver at the moment for pharma strategy,&quot; Kresse said.

Although smaller vaccine companies with new technologies are not likely to produce H1N1 vaccines in time for the current pandemic, the global influenza threat has awakened governments from Egypt to India to the need for flu vaccines.

Novavax Inc this week launched a 4,000-patient clinical trial in Mexico of its H1N1 vaccine, which is grown in caterpillar cells rather than the conventional chicken eggs.

While Kresse thinks biotechs had hoped to benefit more, the pandemic has brought new attention to their technologies.

Demand for an intravenous flu drug may mean earlier approval of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc&apos;s and Shionogi &amp; Co Ltd&apos;s peramivir. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said this week government scientists would soon decide whether to approve emergency use for people too sick to take existing antiviral medications by either pill or inhaler.

In the United States, the biggest early impact from the H1N1 flu will be on companies that make flu tests, said John Sullivan, director of research and Healthcare Strategist at Leerink Swann.

Sullivan said flu-related sales boosted earnings at Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, a scientific instruments maker.

And he expects to see more flu impact on testing companies like Quest Diagnostics Inc and Laboratory Corp of America. Quidel Corp last week posted a quarterly profit that blew past analyst estimates last week, helped by higher demand for its flu tests.

William Blair analysts Mark Miller and Brian Weinstein expect retail drug chains Walgreens and CVS Caremark could reap significantly higher earnings in 2009-2010 on sales of prescription and over-the-counter products, such as cold remedies, hand sanitizers, masks and latex gloves.

As for hospitals, Sullivan said it is too early to tell what impact the pandemic might have. &quot;We are going to watch the hospital industry to see if hospitalizations rise. We have not seen it so far,&quot; he said.

* Say immunization key to stemming pandemic

By Allan Dowd

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Canadian health officials expressed frustration on Friday over what they said were myths about the danger of getting vaccinated against H1N1 flu.

Canada&apos;s immunization program is just getting under way with the federal health department, Health Canada, giving final approval this week to a vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), ruling it is safe and effective.

But officials acknowledge there are public fears that the vaccine could be more dangerous than the disease.

&quot;There are a lot of myths out there,&quot; federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said in Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories.

Complaints about the potential dangers of the vaccination effort, which are often spread over the Internet, include allegations that people will end up contracting flu from the vaccine.

There have also been media reports that the preliminary finding of a Canadian study had suggested that the disease might be linked to past immunization efforts for seasonal flu.

Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, said the alleged dangers are not supported by scientific facts, and the fears are often the result of people making inaccurate assumptions.

&quot;It&apos;s sort of like saying that ice cream causes hot weather because (we see) more ice cream cones on hot days,&quot; Butler-Jones told reporters, saying that some immunization critics are &quot;making up the facts&quot;.

Butler-Jones said Canada was able to slow the virus&apos;s spread by education on the need for personal protection, including regular hand washing, and that it will lose ground in the fight against the disease if myths are painted as fact.

&quot;Immunization is the only thing that will stop the pandemic and prevent however many people from becoming ill,&quot; he said.

Canada, which was one of the first countries to report cases of virus as it initially spread from Mexico, is now into the second wave of the pandemic, federal health officials said.

Immunization is not mandatory in Canada, and usually only half of the population chooses to get vaccinated against seasonal flu. But health officials have said they will have enough H1N1 vaccine available for any Canadian who wants it.

Polls indicate that more Canadians than usual will eventually decide to get the H1N1 vaccine despite the prevalent fears, Butler-Jones said.

Health Canada has been criticized for lagging other countries in approving a vaccine and distributing it, but the debate on whether to take the vaccine has not become a major political issue.

An poll published on Friday by the Canwest New Service found about 49 percent of Canadians are not likely to get vaccinated, with 30 percent saying they are not at all likely to get the shots. Thirty-six percent said they were very likely to get immunized.

Health Canada has been criticized for lagging other countries in approving a vaccine and distributing it, but the debate on whether to take the vaccine has not become a major political issue.

Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline for a national population of more than 33 million.

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Worried about your child&apos;s flu symptoms but don&apos;t want to risk a visit to a germ-infested waiting room?

A free interactive website from The American Medical Association, built with partners Microsoft and personal health record provider Healthy Circles, may be able to help.

The website, AMAfluhelp.org, offers information about seasonal and H1N1 pandemic flu and gives advice on when to seek a doctor&apos;s help.

Unlike sites like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s CDC.gov and flu.gov, this website allows doctors to communicate with patients. Eventually, it will permit doctors to prescribe routine medications online.

During the H1N1 pandemic, the website may help ease the crush of calls to doctors from worried parents and patients and help identify those who need treatment, said Dr. Mary Anne McCaffree, a pediatrician from Oklahoma City and member of the AMA board.

&quot;If you had 25 or so phone calls a day to your office and now you&apos;re having 1,000 calls, it is very hard to find the needle in the haystack to see who is the very sickest,&quot; McCaffree said in a telephone interview.

The website&apos;s introduction during the H1N1 flu pandemic has made it especially useful, offering a way to protect healthier patients from exposure to swine flu by keeping them out of clinic waiting rooms, she said.

The information is based on the latest CDC flu guidelines, which do not account for other potential infections that cause flu-like symptoms, such as group A streptococcus, which is responsible for &quot;strep throat&quot; and can be treated with antibiotics.

For cases like that, parents will still need use their own judgment, said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC.

    <body>* Honeywell encouraged by stabilizing revenue

* Ingersoll-Rand sees 2010 EPS $2-$2.40, above estimates

By Scott Malone and Nick Zieminski

BOSTON/NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers can&apos;t quite see the light at the end of the tunnel, but are growing more confident that they are not going to run off the rails.

Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR.N), which make products ranging from control systems for large buildings to air conditioners, told investors on Friday that after a year of sharp declines in earnings and sales, they expect better conditions in 2010.

Honeywell, the world&apos;s biggest maker of cockpit electronics, expects &quot;flattish&quot; sales next year, Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson said.

&quot;What we&apos;re seeing now is that we&apos;re stabilizing at these new low rates. In other words, the spend levels are way down but they&apos;re stable sequentially, quarter to quarter,&quot; Anderson said in an interview. &quot;The comparisons to prior-year same period are important, but they&apos;re becoming less important than the new run rate that&apos;s being established. And the fact that the new run rate is stable is very, very encouraging.&quot;

The Morris Township, New Jersey-based company said it expected to further reduce expenses next year, but offered no profit forecast, saying it planned to provide that in December. [ID:nN23443925]

But the combination of flat revenue and lower expenses implies &quot;modest profit improvements,&quot; noted Citigroup analyst Jeffrey Sprague.

Ingersoll, however, went further and set an initial 2010 profit forecast. It said it expected operating earnings of $2 to $2.40 per share in 2010, above Wall Street estimates of $1.98 a share. That forecast would mark sharp growth from the $1.58 per share profit analysts expect this year. [ID:nN2386755]

&quot;We are confident we can deliver substantial improvements in earnings versus 2009,&quot; Chief Executive Herb Henkel said on the company&apos;s earnings conference call.

The maker of heating and cooling systems for homes, businesses and transport is counting on cost-cutting to drive the vast bulk of its profit growth. It forecast 2010 revenue up just $200 million from 2009, when analysts on average look for revenue of $13.33 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Even that growth, Henkel said, would be &quot;due solely to the absence of the significant destocking we saw customers undertake in the first half of 2009.&quot;

Both companies, whose equipment is used in buildings that have already been built, were far more conservative in their outlooks than Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), whose earth-moving vehicles are often the first gear on a new construction site.

That Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said it looks for 2010 sales to rise 10 percent to 25 percent.

With the U.S. economy showing tentative signs of recovering from the worst downturn it has faced since the Great Depression of the 1930s, many companies have held back from giving 2010 forecasts.

3M Co (MMM.N), which makes products ranging from films used in flat-panel televisions to masks that can block the H1N1 flu virus, was among the companies holding back.

&quot;I don&apos;t think forecasting is going to get much easier any time soon,&quot; 3M CEO George Buckley told investors on Wednesday. &quot;I hope you&apos;ll bear with us as we try to identify the underlying trends and patterns that will help us get better insight into where the world economy is going.&quot; (Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston and Nick Zieminski in New York, additional reporting by James B.

(Adds analyst comment, shares, H1N1 detail)

By Sam Cage

ZURICH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.VX) said sales would grow faster than expected this year, even without a shot in the arm of up to $700 million from its H1N1 swine flu pandemic vaccine.

Third-quarter net profit at Novartis, which joined other major drugmakers in reporting strong trading conditions, nudged up 1 percent to $2.1 billion, in line with forecasts, the firm said on Thursday.

&quot;A surprisingly strong set of operating figures,&quot; said DZ Bank analyst Thomas Maul. &quot;Management guidance, especially the outlook for the pharmaceuticals division, is amazingly bullish.&quot;

Novartis shares rose 0.5 percent to 52.75 Swiss francs by 0736 GMT, versus a 0.6 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx European healthcare sector .SXDP.

This year is turning out to be better than initially feared for Novartis and other major pharmaceutical companies, thanks to hefty price increases and windfall sales arising from the H1N1 outbreak, though long-term problems like increasing competition from makers of generic drugs have not gone away.

Both Pfizer (PFE.N), the world&apos;s biggest drugmaker, and Eli Lilly (LLY.N) topped earnings forecasts this week and investors will look to U.S. rivals Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N), both due to report later on Thursday, for more clues on the health of the sector. [ID:nN21437353]

Novartis, which faces loss of exclusivity on its top-selling blood pressure drug Diovan in 2012, was hit by one-off charges of $189 million from rival Roche&apos;s (ROG.VX) acquisition of Genentech and discontinuing of a drug by Alcon.

It has a 33 percent stake in Roche and holds 25 percent of eye care company Alcon. It made no comment on an agreement with Nestle (NESN.VX) to acquire a majority of Alcon. [ID:nL8246310]

SWINE FLU BOOSTER

Swine flu is set to provide a significant boost to European drugmakers this year and in the early part of 2010, though the one-off nature of these sales means investors may not set too much store on the resulting profit boost.

Roche reported a sharp jump in sales of its Tamiflu drug for flu last week and analysts expect GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) Relenza will also see strong sales in the third quarter.

On the vaccine front, Glaxo, Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) are all expected to highlight an expected jump in fourth-quarter sales due to swine flu when they unveil results next week.

Novartis now expects group sales to grow at a high single-digit rate, even excluding H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine sales, and sees drugs sales growth at a double-digit rate.

It had previously expected group sales to grow at a mid-single-digit rate in 2009 and drug sales to rise at a minimum high-single-digit rate, both in local currencies.

It added currency-related losses could significantly reduce growth this year.

The H1N1 flu vaccine is expected to contribute about $400-700 million of sales in the fourth quarter.

Novartis trades at about 13 times forecast 2010 earnings, a premium to some of Europe&apos;s other big drugmakers like AstraZeneca, Glaxo and Sanofi but a discount to Swiss rival Roche, which has less exposure to generic competition.

It had been expected to post third-quarter net profit of $2.1 billion, according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nLG252880]

ZURICH, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Novartis&apos; (NOVN.VX) third-quarter net profit nudged up 1 percent to $2.1 billion, hit by one-off costs and in line with forecasts, and the drugmaker expects a boost from its H1N1 swine flu vaccine in the fourth quarter.

It also raised the drugs sales forecast to growth at a double-digit rate in 2009, though currency-related losses could significantly reduce growth.

It is turning out to be a better year for big drugmakers like Novartis than initially feared, thanks to hefty price increases and windfall sales from swine flu, though the long-term problems like increasing generic competition have not gone away.

By Sam Cage

ZURICH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.VX) said sales would grow faster than expected this year, even without a shot in the arm of up to $700 million from its H1N1 swine flu pandemic vaccine.

Third-quarter net profit at Novartis, which joined other major drugmakers in reporting strong trading conditions, nudged up 1 percent to $2.1 billion, in line with forecasts, the firm said on Thursday.

&quot;A surprisingly strong set of operating figures,&quot; said DZ Bank analyst Thomas Maul. &quot;Management guidance, especially the outlook for the pharmaceuticals division, is amazingly bullish.&quot;

Novartis shares rose 0.5 percent to 52.75 Swiss francs by 0736 GMT, versus a 0.6 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx European healthcare sector .SXDP.

This year is turning out to be better than initially feared for Novartis and other major pharmaceutical companies, thanks to hefty price increases and windfall sales arising from the H1N1 outbreak, though long-term problems like increasing competition from makers of generic drugs have not gone away.

Both Pfizer (PFE.N), the world&apos;s biggest drugmaker, and Eli Lilly (LLY.N) topped earnings forecasts this week and investors will look to U.S. rivals Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N), both due to report later on Thursday, for more clues on the health of the sector.

By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - A run on face masks to protect against the flu lifted profits at 3M Co (MMM.N) and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N), and both said demand remains strong as concern over the H1N1 pandemic rises.

The companies, which make face masks along with a wide variety of other products, said on Thursday that flu-related business drove increased sales of masks in the latest quarter.

Shares of 3M rose 2.8 percent, while Kimberly-Clark shot up 6 percent after both companies also raised their full-year forecasts.

Kimberly-Clark and 3M saw demand increase earlier in the year for masks called N95 respirators as concerns about the H1N1 flu spread. Pregnant women and children, as well as adults with underlying health conditions such as asthma, are said to be most vulnerable to H1N1, also known as swine flu.

An N95 respirator covers the nose and mouth tightly, filtering out tiny particles that can carry viruses and bacteria. It is different from a surgical mask, a loose covering that lets air in at the sides and is used to protect patients from the people treating them.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that healthcare workers wear N95 masks to protect themselves when treating patients suspected of having H1N1. The Institute of Medicine agreed in a September report. [ID:nN03145590]

Kimberly-Clark has been working with hospitals for months to help plan for their anticipated need, Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Falk said on a conference call.

&quot;Everyone&apos;s sort of fighting their way through this,&quot; Falk said. &quot;They all say the swine flu has spread faster and farther than maybe it was anticipated.&quot;

&quot;Our guess is it will carry into early 2010 ... but probably begin to wane as we get into the latter part of the first quarter,&quot; he said.

RUNNING FACTORIES 24/7

It is already very difficult for patients to find H1N1 vaccines, which made their debut earlier this month. [ID:nN21504108]

H1N1-related demand for masks helped lift 3M sales by between $80 million and $100 million in the third quarter. Total revenue declined 5.6 percent to $6.2 billion. [ID:nN22533796]

The diversified manufacturer said it has been running its factories that make respiratory masks 24 hours a day, seven days a week since May, and still has not made progress on backlogs.

Kimberly-Clark said stepped-up demand for its masks accounted for about 40 percent of the 18 percent volume jump in its healthcare business.

The healthcare unit, which also makes items such as sterile gloves, was the company&apos;s only segment to post sales growth in the quarter. [ID:nN22484378] Kimberly-Clark also said that exam gloves had their sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.

Manufacturers of hand sanitizers or cleansers, like Ecolab Inc (ECL.N), are also expected to report a lift from flu-related sales when they issue quarterly results in the coming weeks. [ID:nN20432363]

Other makers of N95s include Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) and Alpha Pro Tech (APT.A), whose shares were up 0.7 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. (Additional reporting by James Kelleher in Chicago and Maggie Fox in Washington; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Travelers from Britain, including medical and public health students, brought the new pandemic swine flu to Kenya in the space of a few weeks, researchers reported on Thursday.

Researchers testing out the East African country&apos;s new influenza surveillance system said the arrival of the new H1N1 virus let them watch in real time how a virus spreads. On average, one person infected 26 percent of close household-type contacts, they found -- with one infecting a third of his companions.

Ironically, a team of medical students started it, they reported in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s weekly report on death and disease.

&quot;On June 21, 2009, a group of 34 medical students from Nottingham, United Kingdom, flew from London to Nairobi,&quot; the team at the Kenya Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation wrote.

&quot;During the 9-hour flight, a male student aged 22 years developed headache and chills. The next day, the group took a five-hour bus trip to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya, where an educational service program had been arranged.&quot;

Within days, 70 percent of the students and leaders in the group had flu-like symptoms. Half of them were confirmed to have the H1N1 swine flu virus.

&quot;On June 26, a group of four public health students from London flew to Nairobi and then traveled to Kisumu to work on malaria-related projects,&quot; the researchers added.

A 22-year-old woman became ill and infected another of the students -- a 33 percent &quot;attack rate&quot; for the virus.

The researchers think groups like traveling students may be more likely to infect one another than families.

Two individual travelers also brought H1N1 from Britain -- a 5-year-old boy, who infected one other family member, and a 21-year-old student who infected one of four family members.

Knowing infection rates can help officials project how far and fast a new virus such as H1N1 will spread. As every case is not tested, the information can help them extrapolate the true number of infections

In a second report, published in the journal Eurosurveillance, Brett Archer of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa and colleagues said swine flu was hitting patients with tuberculosis and the AIDS virus especially hard.

&quot;Our data suggests that common infectious conditions such as HIV and TB may be associated with increased mortality risk,&quot; they wrote.

&quot;Even if this elevated risk is found to be relatively small, with the large numbers of HIV and TB infected people in sub-Saharan Africa, this may translate into a substantial public health impact.&quot;

By James B. Kelleher

CHICAGO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer 3M Co (MMM.N) posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its full-year forecast, encouraged by strong demand for consumer electronics and for its respiratory masks, which were snapped up by people afraid of the H1N1 flu virus.

3M said on Thursday its mask factories had been working &quot;24-7&quot; since May trying to keep up, without reducing backlog. Executives estimated that incremental demand related to H1N1 flu virus fears had added somewhere between $80 million and $100 million to its third-quarter sales.

Still, George Buckley, 3M&apos;s chairman, chief executive and president, remained cautious about the near term. He said that so far, despite hundreds of billions of dollars of stimulus spending by governments worldwide, consumers remained cautious in most markets.

&quot;We all know the hardest time to forecast sales accurately is at turning points in demand,&quot; Buckley said. &quot;I don&apos;t think forecasting will get much easier any time soon.&quot;

3M, which makes products ranging from Scotch tape to optical films for liquid crystal display televisions, reported third-quarter net income of $957 million, or $1.35 a share, down from $991 million, or $1.41 a share last year.

Excluding one-time items, 3M reported income of $1.37 a share.

Revenue fell 5.6 percent to $6.2 billion.

The results beat analysts&apos; average forecasts of net income of $1.11 a share, profit excluding one-time items of $1.17 a share, and sales of $5.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company raised its 2009 earnings forecast, saying it now expects full-year earnings to be $4.50 to $4.55 a share, up from a previous range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share.

C. Stephen Tusa, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, called the company&apos;s results &quot;near flawless&quot; and said the raised forecast suggested the improving trends were sustainable at least in the near term.

Sales of 3M&apos;s display and graphics products rose 5.5 percent during the quarter, while healthcare sales -- including sales of protective face masks -- rose 4.7 percent.

Those gains helped offset sales declines in the company&apos;s other areas, including consumer and office products.

3M said it planned to invest $20 million to increase respiratory production capacity in Singapore, the latest such expansion this year.

&quot;Our factories have been running flat out since May of this year to keep up with demand,&quot; Patrick Campbell, the company&apos;s chief finance officer, said during the call.

&quot;And we see back orders well beyond the end of the year.&quot;

The company&apos;s shares were up $2.77, or 3.6 percent, at $79.10 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek, Gary Hill)</body>

    <body>PARIS (Reuters Life!) - As governments rush to roll out mass vaccinations programmes against H1N1 swine flu, one man in western France has launched his own campaign to limit its spread -- use sign language.

Temporarily replacing the French custom of kissing cheeks with simple greetings in sign language would reduce physical contact, said Hubert Chalet, who co-founded Fais-Moi Signe (Give me a Sign), an association for people with impaired hearing.

&quot;What if we substituted cheek-kissing and handshakes with an imaginative and colorful language such as sign language?&quot; Chalet told Reuters by phone from Nantes in western France.

He recommends that television news programmes broadcast the sign language for simple phrases such as &quot;Hello,&quot; &quot;Goodbye,&quot; &quot;How are you?&quot; and &quot;Are you sick?.&quot;

&quot;What I would like to see is a little headline on the midday or evening news on television to go over the phrases,&quot; he said.

These phrases could then be used in group situations, he said, for example when an office worker needs to greet a group of colleagues and remove the need for &quot;banal handshakes which are not always enthusiastic.&quot;

Chalet, 69, worked as a mediator for Fais-Moi Signe for nine years until the organization shut down last year. He now works for humanitarian group L&apos;Ecoute de la Rue, which broadly translates as &quot;listening out on the streets.&quot;

France began its own vaccination campaign on October 20 for hospital staff, and shots will be offered to the general population starting from the first week in November.

There have been 34 H1N1-related deaths in France since the start of the epidemic.

Promoting sign language would also help to bring the hearing and hearing-impaired worlds closer together, Chalet added.

While some may balk at the idea of learning sign language, Chalet suggests that hearing-impaired adults could be usefully employed in schools and firms to help teach the basics.

Chalet has sent his proposal to the local town council but has yet to hear back.

&quot;There are enough specialized institutions ... across France to spread the basic rules of sign language,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I&apos;m allowed to dream, no?.&quot; (Reporting by Sophie Taylor, editing by Paul Casciato)</body>

* Novartis falls 0.1 percent

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Cost cuts helped drugmakers shore up profits in the third quarter, but concerns over sustainable revenue growth continues to worry investors.

Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N) earnings easily beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday, while rivals Novartis (NOVN.VX) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) posted profits largely in line with projections.

But the drug companies posted modest increases in sales and face patent expirations to their biggest products in the next few years, a problem endemic throughout the pharmaceutical industry.

&quot;I&apos;d really like to start seeing more solid top line growth -- they&apos;ve all been rather tepid,&quot; said Eldene Doyle, an equities analyst with Optique Capital Management. &quot;That combined with the patent cliff is really weighing on everybody&apos;s minds.&quot;

Shares of Merck were down 1.3 percent in morning trading in New York after falling as much as 4.3 percent, while Bristol fell 1.2 percent. Swiss-based Novartis slipped 0.1 percent.

Shares of Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N, which has agreed to be bought by Merck, fell 0.6 percent after posting profit that met expectations.

Earlier this week, cost cuts helped both Pfizer (PFE.N), the world&apos;s biggest drugmaker, and Eli Lilly (LLY.N) top forecasts -- though their results also failed to excited investors.

&quot;One thing I&apos;m seeing is continued cost cutting really strengthening the bottom line,&quot; Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. &quot;This is a theme that is going to be playing itself out for several more quarters to come.&quot;

Sales of Merck&apos;s diabetes and HIV treatments combined with cost controls helped drive the better-than-expected quarterly profit, although overall sales rose just 2 percent to $6.05 billion. [ID:nN22532389]

Merck reported net income of $3.42 billion, or $1.61 per share. That compared with $1.09 billion, or 51 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.

Excluding special items, Merck earned 90 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 82 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The New Jersey-based drugmaker forecast full-year earnings of $3.20 to $3.30 per share, excluding items, raising the low end of its earlier forecast from $3.15.

Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said sharp initial declines in Merck shares may have been spurred by concerns that the company -- like other drugmakers that beat third-quarter profit forecasts -- did not raise the upper end of its full-year forecast.

&quot;They just kind of tightened the range,&quot; Fernandez said. He said Merck shares may have also been hurt by concerns that Abbott Laboratories&apos; (ABT.N) Niaspan might prevail against Vytorin and Zetia in a cholesterol study that will be presented at a major medical meeting in November.

Novartis said sales would grow faster than expected this year, even without a shot in the arm of up to $700 million from its H1N1 swine flu pandemic vaccine. [ID:nLM82032]

Third-quarter net profit nudged up 1 percent to $2.1 billion, in line with forecasts. Sales rose 3 percent to $11.09 billion.

Joe Jimenez, chief executive of Novartis&apos; drugs unit, told Reuters its productivity initiative for the year was going well and there is room for further cost savings.

&quot;That is helping significantly to raise our margins at a time when we are investing heavily in our new launches,&quot; Jimenez said.

Novartis now expects group sales to grow at a high single-digit rate, even excluding H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine sales, and sees drugs sales growth at a double-digit rate.

At Bristol-Myers, revenue trailed analyst estimates, although earnings from continuing operations jumped 64 percent. [ID:nN22533377]

Excluding items, Bristol posted earnings of 52 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 51 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 4 percent to $5.49 billion, slightly below the $5.52 billion expected by analysts.

Bristol, which is cutting jobs as part of an efficiency drive, reported an 8 percent decline in marketing, selling and administrative expense, to $1.1 billion.

WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - It will take a month or two for the U.S. Agriculture Department to decide whether to buy more pork to prop up the money-losing hog industry, Deputy Agriculture Undersecretary Michael Scuse said on Thursday.

The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) wants the government to buy at least $50 million of pork products to use for government food assistance programs.

Hog producers have lost, on average, nearly $23 for each hog marketed since September 2009, &quot;and things look bleak going forward,&quot; said NPPC president Don Butler at House Agriculture subcommittee hearing.

Scuse told the subcommittee losses &quot;are expected to moderate from now through 2010 as demand increases and hog supplies decline.

&quot;The department continues to evaluate pork market conditions and, if justified, (USDA) will initiate additional surplus removal purchases this fiscal year,&quot; Scuse said.

USDA spent $164.6 million to buy 100 million lbs of pork during fiscal 2009, ending on Sept. 30, mostly for donation to food banks. It was double the total for fiscal 2008 and included a $30 million purchase announced on Sept. 3 to bolster hog prices.

Scuse told reporters &quot;it could be in the next month, it could be within the next two months&quot; when the USDA&apos;s Agricultural Marketing Service completes an analysis of proposals to buy more pork.

Up to $250 million is available in so-called Section 32 funds, raised by customs receipts, to assist unsubsidized U.S. farm products, such as pork.

During the subcommittee hearing, pork producers, industry experts and meatpacker Seaboard Foods, a part of Seaboard Corp (SEB.A), and industry experts said high feed costs were a leading reason for losses by hog farmers. They also cited the recession and loss of U.S. export markets due to the H1N1 flu scare. (Reporting by Charles Abbott; Editing by Marguerita Choy)</body>

By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) raised its forecast for the year after blowing past third-quarter earnings expectations on cost-cuts and increased demand for face masks to protect against the H1N1 flu virus.

The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers expects to cut costs even more, feel less of a hit from foreign currency and see sales improve this year. Its shares rose 5.1 percent to $62.74 in afternoon trading.

The company is &quot;assuming the economic environment will remain relatively stable for the balance of 2009,&quot; said Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Falk.

Consumers are buying household and personal products, but they continue to feel some pressure, he noted.

&quot;I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s getting a lot worse, but it&apos;s not getting a lot better, either,&quot; Falk said in an interview.

Kimberly-Clark, which also makes Depend undergarments for incontinence, still sees shoppers timing purchases to their budgets.

&quot;Certainly, in categories like incontinence, you&apos;re seeing the senior that&apos;s on a fixed income is tending to load up at the beginning of month,&quot; Falk said.

Also, parents continue to keep children in diapers longer, rather than moving to the company&apos;s more expensive Pull-Ups training pants, he said. &quot;But for most part you&apos;re not seeing huge shifts in consumer behavior.&quot;

PROFIT UP MORE THAN 40 PERCENT

Kimberly-Clark said on Thursday it earned $582 million, or $1.40 per share, in the third quarter, up sharply from $413 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts, on average, expected $1.13 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Analysts said the results were strong overall, even though some categories saw pressure, and were pleased with the company&apos;s improved margins.

&quot;If Kimberly-Clark is any indication, this bodes well for (third-quarter) performance across the group,&quot; especially for Procter &amp; Gamble, Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said.

Shares of P&amp;G, which reports on Oct. 29, rose 0.8 percent.

Kimberly-Clark&apos;s sales fell 1.7 percent to $4.91 billion. Analysts had expected $4.87 billion. The volume of goods sold was little changed from a year earlier.

One bright spot was healthcare, where sales rose 15.8 percent and volume jumped 18 percent. About 40 percent of the volume growth stemmed from face mask demand. [ID:nN22177970]

Sales fell in other units. The consumer tissue unit, whose brands include Kleenex, Cottonelle and Scott, posted the biggest drop with a 5 percent decline.

Kimberly-Clark has seen distribution change as retailers sharpen their focus on product selection. For example, its Scott paper towels are no longer sold at Target (TGT.N), which has focused on more premium products such as Kimberly-Clark&apos;s Viva brand and P&amp;G&apos;s (PG.N) Bounty. But Scott towels were added to the lineup at Wal-Mart&apos;s (WMT.N) Sam&apos;s Club warehouse stores.

&quot;Our overall distribution is pretty similar, but it&apos;s more concentrated in individual outlets than it used to be,&quot; Falk said.

Kimberly-Clark said it now expects to earn $4.50 to $4.60 per share this year, up from a July forecast of $4.10 to $4.25. Analysts&apos; average forecast was $4.26.

The company now expects sales to fall about 2 percent this year. In July it forecast sales would fall 4 percent to 6 percent, versus a prior view of a 6 percent to 8 percent drop.

Kimberly-Clark said it has found additional savings in sourcing and supply chain and now expects to save about $250 million this year, versus prior guidance for savings of at least $200 million.

In June, the company set plans to cut about 1,600 salaried jobs, or roughly 3 percent of its workforce. Under an earlier cost-cutting plan, it eliminated some 6,000 jobs and closed about 20 manufacturing plants. (Reporting by Jessica Wohl; editing by John Wallace and Steve Orlofsky)</body>

MEXICO CITY, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Mexican airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste posted a 27 percent year-on- year drop in net profit in the third quarter, as the H1N1 flu outbreak and economic slump led fewer people to travel.

The company, known as Asur (ASURB.MX)(ASR.N), earned 171 million pesos ($12 million) between July and September, compared with 234 million pesos in the same quarter of 2008.

Passenger traffic was down 14 percent in the quarter and revenues fell almost 3 percent to 715 million pesos, Asur said in a statement on Thursday.

Traffic at Asur&apos;s busy Cancun, Cozumel and Oaxaca airports, all popular tourist destinations, dropped sharply in the quarter, compared with the year-earlier period.

Mexico was the epicenter of an outbreak of a new flu virus in April, which greatly hurt the country&apos;s tourism and airline industries. Foreign visitors remain cautious about traveling to Mexico although the disease has spread globally.

    <body>By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global efforts to immunize children against life-threatening diseases set a record high last year but failed to protect millions of youngsters in the world&apos;s poorest countries, health officials said on Wednesday.

A joint report by the World Health Organization, United Nations and World Bank said 106 million babies under the age of 1 were vaccinated in 2008, while a record 120 vaccines became available against a host of diseases from measles and flu to meningitis and a virus linked to cancer.

The data provide a snapshot of an immunization boom that has tripled the global vaccine market to $17 billion in eight years and set off a renaissance of vaccine development aimed at AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and dengue fever.

The report coincides with new efforts to provide the world with a vaccine against the H1N1 flu that WHO declared a pandemic in June.

Immunization, in a downward spiral before 2000, has gained momentum in recent years partly through a financing partnership among WHO, the U.N. childrens&apos; fund UNICEF, the World Bank and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

The partnership, known as the GAVI Alliance, also includes drug makers such as GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Novartis AG, Crucell NV, Merck &amp; Co. Inc., Sanofi Pasteur and Wyeth.

As a result of recent efforts, vaccines now reach more than 200 million children in developing countries.

But the report also acknowledged significant shortcomings in the immunization campaign, saying that 24 million infants -- almost 20 percent of the children born each year -- did not receive first-year-of-life vaccinations that are common in the wealthiest countries.

The children who missed out typically live in poorly served remote rural areas, deprived urban settings, fragile states and strife-torn regions, mostly in Africa and Asia.

MAJOR PUSH

The report said a major push was under way to protect children in difficult-to-reach areas.

It estimated that an additional investment of $1 billion would be needed to ensure that new and existing vaccines are available to all children in the world&apos;s 72 poorest countries where preventable diseases take their deadliest toll.

Rising demand for immunization has been a boon to manufacturers in the developing world, which now meet 86 percent of global demand for traditional vaccines against disease such as measles, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria.

But so-called middle-income countries are not eligible for financial assistance from the GAVI Alliance, even though many of their people live on less than $2 a day. That makes it hard for them to afford new vaccines against pneumococcal disease, rotavirus diarrhea and the human papillomavirus that can cause cervical, penile and head and neck cancers.

&quot;Even at greatly reduced prices, the cost of new vaccines ... are individually greater than the cost of all other traditional vaccines combined,&quot; the report said.

Still the report said immunization was partly responsible for the first documented decline in annual deaths among children to below 10 million. Clean water, sanitation and better care were the other contributing factors.

The report also credited immunization with helping to bring about a 74 percent drop in worldwide deaths from measles between 2000 and 2007.

CHICAGO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) raised its forecast for the year after blowing past third-quarter earnings expectations on cost-cuts and increased demand for face masks to protect against the H1N1 flu virus.

The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers expects to cut costs even more, feel less of a hit from foreign currency and see sales improve this year. Its shares rose 5.1 percent to $62.74 in afternoon trading.

The company is &quot;assuming the economic environment will remain relatively stable for the balance of 2009,&quot; said Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Falk.

Consumers are buying household and personal products, but they continue to feel some pressure, he noted.

&quot;I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s getting a lot worse, but it&apos;s not getting a lot better, either,&quot; Falk said in an interview.

Kimberly-Clark, which also makes Depend undergarments for incontinence, still sees shoppers timing purchases to their budgets.

&quot;Certainly, in categories like incontinence, you&apos;re seeing the senior that&apos;s on a fixed income is tending to load up at the beginning of month,&quot; Falk said.

Also, parents continue to keep children in diapers longer, rather than moving to the company&apos;s more expensive Pull-Ups training pants, he said. &quot;But for most part you&apos;re not seeing huge shifts in consumer behavior.&quot;

PROFIT UP MORE THAN 40 PERCENT

Kimberly-Clark said on Thursday it earned $582 million, or $1.40 per share, in the third quarter, up sharply from $413 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts, on average, expected $1.13 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Analysts said the results were strong overall, even though some categories saw pressure, and were pleased with the company&apos;s improved margins.

&quot;If Kimberly-Clark is any indication, this bodes well for (third-quarter) performance across the group,&quot; especially for Procter &amp; Gamble, Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said.

Shares of P&amp;G, which reports on Oct. 29, rose 0.8 percent.

Kimberly-Clark&apos;s sales fell 1.7 percent to $4.91 billion. Analysts had expected $4.87 billion. The volume of goods sold was little changed from a year earlier.

One bright spot was healthcare, where sales rose 15.8 percent and volume jumped 18 percent. About 40 percent of the volume growth stemmed from face mask demand. [ID:nN22177970]

Sales fell in other units. The consumer tissue unit, whose brands include Kleenex, Cottonelle and Scott, posted the biggest drop with a 5 percent decline.

Kimberly-Clark has seen distribution change as retailers sharpen their focus on product selection. For example, its Scott paper towels are no longer sold at Target (TGT.N), which has focused on more premium products such as Kimberly-Clark&apos;s Viva brand and P&amp;G&apos;s (PG.N) Bounty. But Scott towels were added to the lineup at Wal-Mart&apos;s (WMT.N) Sam&apos;s Club warehouse stores.

&quot;Our overall distribution is pretty similar, but it&apos;s more concentrated in individual outlets than it used to be,&quot; Falk said.

Kimberly-Clark said it now expects to earn $4.50 to $4.60 per share this year, up from a July forecast of $4.10 to $4.25. Analysts&apos; average forecast was $4.26.

The company now expects sales to fall about 2 percent this year. In July it forecast sales would fall 4 percent to 6 percent, versus a prior view of a 6 percent to 8 percent drop.

Kimberly-Clark said it has found additional savings in sourcing and supply chain and now expects to save about $250 million this year, versus prior guidance for savings of at least $200 million.

In June, the company set plans to cut about 1,600 salaried jobs, or roughly 3 percent of its workforce. Under an earlier cost-cutting plan, it eliminated some 6,000 jobs and closed about 20 manufacturing plants. (Reporting by Jessica Wohl; editing by John Wallace and Steve Orlofsky)</body>

    <title>Hundreds throng US clinic for H1N1 flu vaccine</title>

    <body>ROCKVILLE, Maryland, Oct 21 (Reuters) - More than 1,700 people in search of H1N1 swine flu vaccine thronged the public health clinic in a Washington suburb on Wednesday, but in the end many at risk for severe infections were simply turned away.

The long lines support the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s assessment that Americans want the vaccine, despite some highly vocal critics who say they fear it may not be safe.

&quot;They got in line as early as 10 o&apos;clock last night. They were here at midnight. They were here at 5 a.m. The clinic started at 9 a.m.,&quot; said Montgomery County health officer Dr. Ulder Tillman.

But within 90 minutes, the clinic was out of the injectable vaccine needed by many of those most vulnerable to swine flu: pregnant women and children or adults with underlying health conditions including asthma.

&quot;We are not able now to provide vaccine to pregnant women,&quot; Tillman told Reuters Television.

There was plenty of vaccine nasal spray from AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit, which is not suitable for some high risk people because of its formulation using a live but weakened form of flu virus.

But health officials had only 249 doses of injectable vaccine because of manufacturing problems that have prompted the U.S. government to cut its production estimates for October from 40 million doses to between 28 million and 30 million.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress on Wednesday that those problems have been overcome and that production is expected to be back on track early in November. [ID:nN21505080]

County spokeswoman Mary Anderson said local injectable vaccine supplies have been running significantly below expectations, perhaps by as much as 40 percent.

&quot;The injectable vaccine we had is what we got last week. We haven&apos;t had anything new since then,&quot; she said.

The U.S. government has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies: AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK.L) and CSL Ltd (CSL.AX).

Flu vaccine is made using old technology that involves growing the virus in chicken eggs, and it takes months to make a new formulation to match circulating flu strains.

Makers of injectable vaccine have had more problems than expected getting vaccine doses from eggs. There have also been problems with new production lines set up to meet the orders.

In suburban Maryland, people said they wanted the protection now because H1N1 is already widespread and expected to intensify as colder weather sets in.

They came well-prepared for a long wait. Many dressed in layers against the October chill and brought snacks while some showed up with lawn chairs.

County officials expect to hold H1N1 clinics at public health offices every week and will soon begin vaccinations in local schools. (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)</body>

* Second vaccine for pregnant women on order (Adds details, comments from government)

OTTAWA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Canada will be ready to begin H1N1 flu vaccinations next week after the Canadian government approved on Wednesday a H1N1 vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) that will be used for most of the population, federal health officials said.

Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses from the company and at least 2 million have already been sent around the country, but regulatory approval was required before they could be used.

The federal government had initially slated the first week of November for the start of the vaccinations, but provincial governments, which are responsible for health care in Canada, will now be able to start the country&apos;s largest ever immunization effort whenever they are ready.

&quot;It&apos;s our best defence against being infected by this virus and spreading it to others,&quot; Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, told a news conference in Ottawa.

The vaccine, called Arepanrix, should be in use next week, he said, with millions more doses sent weekly to provincial governments during the vaccination period. It contains adjuvant, which is a natural product that allows for more effective use of vaccine supplies.

The government in British Columbia, where most of Canada&apos;s recent flu outbreak has emerged, said it would begin vaccinations on Monday.

The federal government has also ordered 1.8 million doses of a second vaccine, without adjuvant, specifically for pregnant women. It will be available in early November.

The Canadian government recommends that people at greatest risk should get the vaccine first -- people under 65 with chronic conditions, pregnant women, children six months to five years old, people in remote communities, health care workers and care providers of high-risk persons.

Health officials will largely trust those lining up first for flu shots that they fit one of those criteria, Butler-Jones said.

The virus is different from seasonal flu virus in that it has a strong effect on young people, he said. Teenagers accounted for half of all flu deaths in the United States recently, he said.

Vaccinations are already under way in various countries including the United States, China, Australia. Britain began immunization on Wednesday.

The H1N1 pandemic has killed 83 people in Canada and hospitalized 1,500. Canada has a population of 33.7 million people.

Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said no decision has been made on whether Canada will share surplus vaccine supplies with other countries. (Reporting by Rod Nickel and Randall Palmer; editing by Peter Galloway)</body>

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Results of tens of thousands of flu tests indicate that the pandemic H1N1 virus is spreading from school-aged children to the rest of the U.S. population, makers of the tests say.

Quest Diagnostics (DGX.N), which makes a commercially available test that can confirm swine flu infection, said the findings suggest many more adults will be infected with the new H1N1 influenza.

&quot;Based on tests performed since Quest Diagnostics began offering H1N1 testing in May 2009, children between the ages of five to 14 have experienced higher overall rates of H1N1 positivity than any other age group,&quot; the company said in its report.

The Quest test is a PCR test -- it magnifies the genetic material of the virus so it can be detected and is similar to the tests used by state health departments to confirm H1N1.

On-the-spot flu tests given in doctor&apos;s offices only tell if a person has influenza A or not. They cannot tell which strain, and they often miss the new H1N1 strain completely.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given up trying to count how many people have the new H1N1, saying only that is it well over a million. Only select cases are tested.

The CDC reported that data from 27 U.S. states shows 53 percent of people sick enough to be hospitalized with H1N1 flu are under the age of 25, with only 7 percent of hospitalizations among people 65 and older -- a reversal of the trend seen with seasonal flu.

Dr. Jay Lieberman, medical director for Quest Diagnostics and a pediatrician at the University of California, Irvine, says data from Quest&apos;s testing, based on 76,500 specimens taken between May 11 and October 11, 2009, can supplement the CDC&apos;s findings, which cover fewer than 5,000 patients.

SHARP RISE

The sharp rise in cases in children came at the end of August and beginning of September, Lieberman told Reuters in a telephone interview.

&quot;What is interesting is that we are now seeing delayed by several weeks a rise in other age groups -- in the elderly, in people aged 50 to 64 and in children under 5 years of age,&quot; Lieberman said.

Influenza often spreads from school-aged children to siblings, parents and eventually grandparents./

&quot;What we have seen in the pandemic so far is that the elderly have been relatively spared. That may start to change in the weeks ahead,&quot; Lieberman said.

Many scientists think the elderly are less likely to be infected because they have some immunity to the H1N1 virus.

Lieberman said the findings show it is important to vaccinate children against influenza to slow the spread in the community.

Cases are evenly divided by gender, Quest said, and about half of all samples sent for testing -- by doctor&apos;s offices, state and county health departments -- turn out to be H1N1.

H1N1 has been mild to moderate so far. Lieberman said had it been a more pathogenic virus, causing severe disease in more people, officials likely would have closed schools to help slow its spread until more vaccines could have become available. (Editing by Jackie Frank)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delivery of some swine flu vaccines has been delayed because companies cannot make it as fast as they had hoped, just as the virus has really started to spread, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said that while 40 million doses had been anticipated for the end of October, only about 28 to 30 million doses would be available.

&quot;Yields for vaccine are lower than would be hoped,&quot; Schuchat said in a telephone briefing. &quot;We unfortunately won&apos;t have as much at the end of this month as we had hoped to.&quot;

She also said deaths from H1N1 swine flu were above the epidemic threshold in some U.S. cities and states. H1N1 flu activity was widespread in 41 states, she said.

&quot;It is unprecedented for this time of year to have the whole country having such high levels of activity,&quot; Schuchat said.

&quot;There are now a total of 86 children under 18 who have died from the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,&quot; she added. Many had died in recent weeks and the number was now higher than the usual number of child deaths in an entire flu season.

&quot;These are very sobering statistics ... 43 deaths in one month is a lot,&quot; Schuchat said. &quot;Some of these children have been totally healthy.&quot;

Older children were hardest hit, she said, with 16 deaths among 5- to 11-year-olds and 19 deaths in 12- to 17-year-olds.

The new virus, which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June, does not seem any deadlier than seasonal influenza. But it attacks a different age group -- older children and young adults, unlike seasonal flu, which affects mostly elderly people and kills up to 36,000 in a normal year.

And because hardly anyone has immunity, the H1N1 virus may infect far more people than seasonal flu does in a single season.

BUMPY DELIVERY

Schuchat said 15 percent to 20 percent of patients with H1N1 who needed to be hospitalized were requiring intensive care. &quot;Influenza is widespread in the country and illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase,&quot; she said.

The U.S. government has opted to roll out seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1 vaccines as they become available, which the CDC has said could make for a bumpy vaccination plan.

People need both vaccines to be protected from all the circulating viruses, although Schuchat says virtually all cases of influenza are due to the new H1N1 virus.

As of Wednesday, 11.4 million doses of H1N1 vaccine were available and 8 million had been ordered by states for distribution.

The U.S. government has ordered both types of flu vaccine from five companies: Sanofi-Aventis SA, CSL Ltd, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca unit MedImmune.

Schuchat said 82 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine had been distributed, with a total of 114 million doses ordered. On Thursday CVS Caremark Corp said it would cut short its flu-shot clinics due to delivery delays.

&quot;This is how influenza vaccine production often goes,&quot; Schuchat said. She said there should be widespread availability by November and advised people who wanted a vaccine but were having trouble finding one to keep trying.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Half of those hospitalized with the new H1N1 virus are under 25, a clear illustration that the pandemic is affecting the young disproportionately, U.S. health officials said Tuesday.

They said reports from 27 U.S. states show 53 percent of people sick enough to be hospitalized with H1N1 flu are under the age of 25, with only 7 percent of hospitalizations among people 65 and older.

&quot;This is really, really different from what we see with seasonal flu,&quot; the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters. &quot;With seasonal flu, about 60 percent of hospitalizations occur in people 65 and over.

She stressed the report was incomplete but said if anything, it was underestimating the extent of the pandemic.

An analysis of 292 deaths from 28 states showed that younger people than usual are also dying, she said.

&quot;Almost a quarter of deaths are occurring in young people under the age of 25. Specifically, 23.6 percent of the deaths are in that age group. About 65 percent of the deaths are in people 25 to 64 years of age,&quot; Schuchat said.

Just 12 percent of deaths were among people over 65. In a normal year, 90 percent of those who die from flu are over 65.

With cooler weather, other viruses and infections are showing up, making the picture confusing.

Schuchat said influenza is being diagnosed in about 30 percent of all people showing up with &quot;influenza-like illness,&quot; symptoms that include cough, sore throat, fever and aches.

Almost all influenza is turning out to be H1N1 rather than seasonal influenza and Schuchat said the tests often miss cases of H1N1, so the percentage may be higher.

Ordinary colds, group A streptococcus, which causes &quot;strep throat,&quot; and other infections can cause similar symptoms.

The U.S. government is trying to vaccinate people against both seasonal influenza and H1N1 at the same time, making both vaccines available as manufacturers finish, bottle and get them approved batch by batch.

President Barack Obama received his seasonal influenza vaccine Tuesday, according to a White House spokesman, who said he would &quot;wait his turn&quot; to get an H1N1 vaccine.

Five companies make both types for the U.S. market: Sanofi-Aventis SA, CSL Ltd, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca unit MedImmune.

Schuchat said H1N1 vaccine was becoming available slowly.

&quot;As of yesterday, 12.8 million doses were available for the states to order. More than half of that was available in the injectable form. So that&apos;s helpful, with giving us a variety of formulations,&quot; she said.

She said states had ordered 10.8 million doses so far.

* HHS keen to build armaments against H1N1

* Vaccine production hurdles overcome (Updates throughout)

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - A top U.S. health official said on Wednesday new influenza drugs could be approved within days for people critically ill with swine flu and assured Congress that H1N1 vaccine production problems have been overcome.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said government scientists would soon decide whether to approve the intravenous use of experimental drugs for people too sick to take existing antiviral medications by either pill or inhaler.

&quot;It is imminent,&quot; she said at a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Asked by the panel&apos;s chairman, Senator Joe Lieberman, if a decision could come within days, Sebelius replied: &quot;We hope that&apos;s the case.&quot;

Two antiviral drugs are recommended for flu: Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir and marketed under license from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) by Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX); and Relenza, known generically as zanamivir and made by GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) under license from Australia&apos;s Biota Inc (BTA.AX).

Lieberman urged Sebelius to ensure that enough intravenous antivirals were available, citing estimates from White House science advisers that 150,000 to 300,000 Americans could require hospitalization in intensive care units because of H1N1.

&quot;There could be a lot of people looking for the IV antiviral,&quot; he said.

Because influenza viruses mutate so quickly, health officials are keen for new drugs and several are in the works.

Furthest along in the pipeline is Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc&apos;s (BCRX.O) and Shionogi &amp; Co&apos;s (4507.T) peramivir.

BioCryst has said it was starting two late-stage trials testing the intravenous formulation of peramivir to treat hospitalized patients with serious influenza.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

In 2007, BioCryst was awarded a $102.6 million, four-year contract from HHS to develop peramivir for the treatment of influenza. Last month it got another $77.2 million from the department to complete late-stage development.

Relenza, an inhaled drug, can also be formulated for intravenous use.

Lieberman also expressed concern about a delay in H1N1 vaccine production that prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week to cut its supply estimates to 28 million to 30 million from 40 million doses for October.

&quot;H1N1 is so contagious it may well be getting ahead of our ability, public health&apos;s ability, to respond to it,&quot; he said.

But Sebelius said manufacturers had overcome two problems: unexpectedly low dose yields from chicken eggs used to produce the vaccine and glitches in new production lines.

&quot;Those two issues have been corrected,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;re hoping by early November that they will be back on the track for the number of vaccination doses per week that we had originally anticipated.&quot;

The flu vaccine is made using old technology that involves growing the virus in chicken eggs, and it takes months to make a new formulation to match circulating flu strains.

For the current season, the U.S. government has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies: AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Pasteur (SASY.PA), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and CSL (CSL.AX). (Editing by Maggie Fox and Eric Beech)</body>

* HHS keen to build armaments against H1N1

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Approval for the emergency intravenous use of experimental new antiviral drugs for patients critically ill with H1N1 swine flu could come within days, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Wednesday.

The new drugs, which could supplement existing supplies of the flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, could help patients too sick to take pills or use an inhaler, and would add to choices available if and when the virus develops resistance to the current drugs.

&quot;The good news is we have encouraging results from several different candidates and we anticipate final decisions being made by the scientists very shortly,&quot; Sebelius told a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

&quot;It is imminent,&quot; Sebelius said, and when asked if a decision could come in a matter of days, she replied: &quot;We hope that&apos;s the case.&quot;

Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir and marketed under license from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) by Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX), is a pill in a class of antivirals known as meuraminidase inhibitors.

During the 2008-2009 flu season one of the circulating influenza viruses, an H1N1 strain distantly related to the pandemic swine flu, developed resistance to Tamiflu. So far the pandemic swine flu is almost fully susceptible to Tamiflu but doctors say that could change at any time.

A similar drug is Relenza, known generically as zanamivir, made by GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) under license from Australia&apos;s Biota Inc (BTA.AX), and is inhaled, although it can be formulated for intravenous use.

PROMISING NEW DRUG

Because influenza viruses mutate so quickly, health officials are keen for new drugs and several are in the works.

Furthest along in the pipeline is Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc&apos;s (BCRX.O) and Shionogi &amp; Co&apos;s (4507.T) peramivir.

BioCryst has said it was starting two late-stage trials testing the intravenous formulation of peramivir to treat hospitalized patients with serious influenza.

In 2007, BioCryst was awarded a $102.6 million, four-year contract from HHS to develop peramivir for the treatment of influenza. Last month it got another $77.2 million from the department to complete late-stage development.

&quot;We are very encouraged by the results but the scientists will lead our recommendations in terms of getting that antiviral on the market,&quot; Sebelius said.

The U.S. government is racing to vaccinate as many people as possible against H1N1, as well as against seasonal influenza, but production has been slow. Sebelius said companies are working to speed things up, but officials all agree that better vaccine technology is needed.

The flu vaccine is made using old technology that involves growing the virus in chicken eggs, and it takes months to make a new formulation to match circulating flu strains.

&quot;It is important that when the next pandemic hits, we are better prepared to mount a speedy, agile response,&quot; Sebelius said in her written testimony to the panel.

For the current season, the U.S. government has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies: AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Pasteur (SASY.PA), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and CSL (CSL.AX).

    <body>Oct 21 (Reuters) - European governments are starting to roll out mass vaccination programmes against H1N1 swine flu, with Britain the latest country to begin immunisation on Wednesday.

The European Medicines Agency has approved three H1N1 vaccines -- GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) Pandemrix, Novartis&apos;s (NOVN.VX) Focetria and Baxter International&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan -- and others may yet be added to this list.

There have been a total of 230 deaths linked to H1N1 in Europe since April, with nearly half of them occurring in Britain, according to the Stockholm-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Outside Europe, vaccination programmes are also underway in various countries, including the United States, China and Australia.

Here is a snapshot of vaccination plans in selected European countries:

BRITAIN

Nationwide vaccination programme launched on Oct. 21, starting with front-line health workers and hospital patients deemed to be at high risk. Family doctors will start immunising patients in priority groups from Oct. 26.

FRANCE

Vaccinations began on Oct. 20 for hospital staff. Shots will be offered to the general population starting from the first week in November.

GERMANY

Regional states will start a programme of vaccination on Oct. 26. The initial focus will be on healthcare workers, police and fire-fighters, plus people in at-risk groups and pregnant women.

ITALY

Doctors began H1N1 vaccinations on Oct. 14.

SWEDEN

First vaccinations were carried out on Oct. 12.

SPAIN

Vaccinations are expected to start in the second half of November.

NETHERLANDS

Officials expect to start vaccination of at-risk groups in the week starting Nov. 9.

IRELAND

A national vaccination programme will begin on Nov. 2.

SWITZERLAND

H1N1 vaccines still need to be approved by the country&apos;s own regulatory agency and immunisation is not expected to start until around the end of this month or the start of November.

    <body>Oct 21 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- Under intense pressure from the international community, Afghan President Hamid Karzai reluctantly agreed Tuesday to a run-off election as speculation builds that the vote -- with its potentially huge cost in terms of Afghan lives and government credibility -- may ultimately be avoided.

- The complicated fight over Vancouver&apos;s Olympics bylaws has got messier as the city announced it would amend them to make sure Charter rights to freedom of speech are protected.

- Hoards of the H1N1 influenza vaccine are being stockpiled in provincial and territorial warehouses, with the gates ready to swing open when Health Canada gives the green light, which could come as early as Wednesday.

BUSINESS:

- The Bank of Canada is pushing back against currency speculators who are driving the dollar to uncomfortable heights and sapping the strength of the economic rebound.

The central bank on Tuesday laid bare to the markets just why Canada might not be such a great short-term bet, a move that knocked back the dollar, at least for now.

- WestJet Airlines Ltd (WJA.TO), which does not offer business class, is planning a trial project to designate an &quot;empty middle-seat zone&quot; in the first eight to 10 rows of its single-aisle planes between Calgary and Hawaii, as well as Edmonton and Hawaii, perhaps charging a fee of at least C$20 one-way to sit in those rows.

- A new method for tracking TV ratings has shaken up the television sector, resulting in significant swings in audience numbers. Randomly selected viewers now carry pager-like devices on their hips, which silently track what shows they watch by listening for audio signals embedded in each channel&apos;s programming.

At the end of the day, the pagers transmit the data back to BBM Canada in Toronto, which tabulates the ratings.

NATIONAL POST:

- As Pakistani troops battled on Monday for control of the small South Waziristan town of Kotkai, the hometown of the Pakistani Taliban&apos;s two top leaders, suicide bombers walked into the heart of the University of Islamabad and blew themselves up, killing seven people and wounding 26 others.

- To reduce the risk of the H1N1 virus mutating, livestock workers were pressed Tuesday to get their flu shots following the discovery of a turkey flock with the illness.

- A Federal Court judge has set aside the legal protection shielding a covert source used by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service to gather intelligence against Mohamed Harkat, an Ottawa man accused of having terrorist ties.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Ontario&apos;s Finance Minister Dwight Duncan is bracing taxpayers for years of budget deficits, warning Canada&apos;s most populous province could be in for a &quot;long, slow grind&quot; before it swings back to true economic recovery.

- The chief executive of Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO), Hunter Harrison, who is set to retire at the end of the year, has issued a stern warning to his successor, Claude Mongeau, the railway&apos;s &quot;chief railroader in training.&quot;

&quot;He told me he would come out of his grave if we don&apos;t continue to perform, or if we cut the dividend,&quot; Mongeau said on a conference call Tuesday. &quot;I have no intention of having that sight coming my way.&quot;</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 100 new cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy got infected with swine flu at a July 4 barbecue and fireworks display but quick isolation measures got it under control within two weeks, researchers reported on Tuesday.

The outbreak provided a unique opportunity to study the virus closely and Dr. Catherine Takacs Witkop and colleagues say they discovered some surprising things. Among them:

* Nearly a quarter, or 24 percent, of patients still had virus in their noses seven days after getting sick, including 19 percent who had been well for at least 24 hours

* Tamiflu, the drug used to treat influenza, did not help any of the previously healthy young men and women get better any quicker.

* Most cadets were sick for five days or longer

* Eleven percent of the cadets became infected.

In June, soon after the new H1N1 virus was declared a pandemic, 1,376 new cadets arrived for their first training at the academy, near Colorado Springs, Colorado. By July 24, 134 confirmed and 33 suspected cases were identified, Witkop&apos;s team reported in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The cadets, unusually young and healthy, all did well and none became seriously ill or died. Most cases were traced to a July 4 party for the cadets, Witkop said.

&quot;It was about 48 to 72 hours later that we saw the increase in the cadets presenting with the symptoms,&quot; Witkop said in a telephone interview.

Witkop said the academy doctors quickly designated one dormitory for the sick cadets and kept them away from the others.

They tested them daily for the virus, painting a picture of the course of the disease far more detailed than has been possible before.

IN THE NOSE

Eleven, or 19 percent, of nose washes taken from 58 patients who had been free of symptoms for a full 24 hours still contained virus, although it is not clear if the patients were still contagious.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that H1N1 patients can return to work and school 24 hours after their symptoms such as fever go away.

The CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said researchers know people, especially children, can carry the virus long after they are better. &quot;Shedding doesn&apos;t mean you are spreading,&quot; Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing. &quot;Fever is a good marker of infectiousness or ability to spread.&quot;

Many of the cadets were treated with oseltamivir, pills sold by Roche AG under the Tamiflu brand name, but they did not get better any more quickly than untreated cadets.

&quot;We did use it in the hope that we would stem the tide of the outbreak but I don&apos;t think the Tamiflu was the key player in the outreak resolution,&quot; Witkop said.

&quot;I think it was ... the isolation protocol,&quot; she added. Cadets stayed in the sick dorm until they were free of symptoms for 24 hours, or for seven days after first getting sick, whichever was longer.

The CDC recommends saving Tamiflu for people most at risk of getting severely ill from flu, such as pregnant women, people with diabetes or asthma or disabled children.

The academy also quickly educated the cadets about washing hands and not spreading germs by covering their coughs, and Witkop said they used a great deal of hand sanitizer, which may have helped control the outbreak within 10 to 14 days.

    <body>By Gregg Keizer - Computerworld

With Windows 7&apos;s launch just a day away, it&apos;s time to start thinking about how to prepare your aging-but-still useful PC running Windows XP for that move you&apos;re dying to make.

Problem is, Microsoft &apos;s not offering an &quot;in-place&quot; upgrade from XP to Windows 7 , one that will leave everything in place and simply swap out the operating system. Unfortunately for XP fans, that&apos;s reserved for Windows Vista users only. And you avoided Vista like a bad case of H1N1, right?

It&apos;s not any comfort when you read lines like &quot;upgrading from XP on the same hardware will be tricky.&quot;

That&apos;s why we&apos;re here to help lower your blood pressure with answers to your questions about how to get ready for tomorrow -- or later -- when you pull the trigger on Windows 7 and finally, finally leave XP fading in the rearview mirror.

How do I know if my XP machine can handle Windows 7? Run the &quot;Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor,&quot; which went final just yesterday. Download and install the advisor from Microsoft&apos;s support site , then run it. (Warning: You have to have .NET Framework 2.0 or later to run this on XP.) The advisor will give you a bottom-line appraisal of your XP-based hardware: It will either green light the upgrade, tell you the machine won&apos;t make it as is, or spell out what you need to beef up.

The advisor will also mark those devices, both external hardware like printers and internal components such as the graphics chipset or card, that will require new Windows 7 drivers, and indicate whether those drivers are available.

What if I need more juice? In the time remaining, you may be hard pressed to futz with the hardware, but one thing you can do in a few minutes to make the machine more Windows 7 worthy is to add more RAM. Microsoft says the minimum memory is 1GB for the 32-bit version of Windows 7, but recommends 2GB for &quot;optimal performance&quot; on the 64-bit edition. Frankly, those numbers are just crazy. RAM is dirt cheap these days, and even if the new OS runs in just 1GB or 2GB, it&apos;ll run much better with 2GB or more. Punch it up to 4GB -- the maximum for 32-bit Windows 7 -- or beyond (for 64-bit) and you&apos;ll be livin&apos; the dream.

Our favorite source of RAM is Crucial.com . It&apos;s the not the cheapest place on the Web to buy memory, but we&apos;ve never been disappointed by the quality of the modules it sells. Plus, the online scanner is slick: Just run it from the PC you want to upgrade and it will sniff out how much RAM is already in the machine, how much it can take, and what modules apply.

How do I know whether my software and peripherals will run on Windows 7? Yesterday, Microsoft finally fired up its Windows 7 Compatibility Center , a searchable database that you can ping to see what software and hardware is up to Windows 7&apos;s standards.

The most conspicuous absentees on the software side include security programs: You&apos;ll probably have to upgrade to a new edition of your favorite (and pay the price). Microsoft has set up a page here that lists the security software compatible with Windows 7. Another option: The for-free Microsoft Security Essentials , which went live late last month .

Okay, my system is up to snuff. What next? Your first step should be to make a disk image of your XP machine as it exists now so that, heaven forbid, if you later decide Windows 7 isn&apos;t worth its disc and you want to return to XP, you can do so without a lot of hassle.

There are lots of free and for-a-fee backup programs for XP, some of which create a disk image, a bit-for-bit copy of the hard disk. Among the free choices are Macrium Reflect and DriveImageXML , which run on XP and let you create an image on a CD/DVD, external drive or flash drive.

Disk image done. What about my data? Good question.

Since the Windows XP-to-7 upgrade -- Microsoft calls it a &quot;custom&quot; install during the process, others dub it a &quot;clean&quot; install -- will delete all your data, you need to back up the files you want to access later. Windows 7 includes a migration utility called &quot;Windows Easy Transfer&quot; that backs up files you select. Frankly, most users will take that tack to shunt their stuff from old to new.

Microsoft has an old, but still valid set of instructions on how to use the utility on its support site. Print out the page for reference when you do the upgrade.

But if you do it yourself, sans Windows Easy Transfer, you&apos;ll have more control.

You can back up data using any number of backup programs to a variety of media, including CD, DVD, a flash drive or an external hard drive. A simpler method, though, is to simply copy the files from the XP machine; that means you&apos;ll need more space -- backup software typically compresses the data -- but on the plus side, you can just copy it back to the computer once Windows 7 has been installed.

Remember: Even if you use Windows Easy Transfer, you&apos;ll need a backup destination, like an external or flash drive, CD or DVD.

I don&apos;t have a CD or DVD drive to burn discs, and I don&apos;t have an external drive. Where do I back up my data? You&apos;re the perfect candidate for an online storage service.

Computerworld &apos;s Lucas Mearian covered a number of consumer-grade online backup services last July, but two deserve special attention for this part of your Windows 7 prep: Mozy and Carbonite.

Mozy offers 2GB of storage space for free, and lets you buy an unlimited amount on a per-month basis for just $5 a month. Carbonite , meanwhile, gives prospective customers an unlimited amount of storage free for 15 days, plenty of time to back up your data from Windows XP, then restore it to Windows 7 once that&apos;s on your PC.

Both Mozy and Carbonite work with Windows 7 now, according to the two companies.

Another contender is Microsoft&apos;s free SkyDrive , which maxes out at 25GB of storage space. The caveat: SkyDrive limits individual uploaded files to 50MB or less.

What about e-mail? How do I prep that? Tough one.

If you&apos;re using Outlook Express -- the now-obsolete free e-mail client bundled with Windows XP -- you&apos;ll find a full set of instructions here on how to migrate the kit and caboodle to Windows 7 (you&apos;ll have to download Windows Live Mail separately, since Microsoft dumped, among other programs, an e-mail app from the new OS).

Similar directions for moving content of the more full-featured Outlook from one machine to another (as in an XP-to-Windows 7 upgrade) can be found here .

For other e-mail clients, your best shot is to search using strings such as &quot; e-mail client name migrate&quot; and see what comes up. That search for Thunderbird, for example, revealed that all you need to do is copy the &quot;C:\Documents &amp; Settings\ username \Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles&quot; folder found on the XP machine to your backup destination, then later copy that to the same location on the new PC after reinstalling Thunderbird.

I don&apos;t want to recreate my browser&apos;s bookmarks and site passwords, or all the other tweaks I&apos;ve made to app? What do I do? If you&apos;re using Internet Explorer on XP, it&apos;s pretty straight-forward.

In IE8, for instance, click on &quot;Favorites,&quot; then on &quot;Add to Favorites Bar,&quot; and select &quot;Import and Export.&quot; Chose &quot;Export to a file,&quot; then click &quot;Next.&quot; Select all three boxes -- &quot;Favorites,&quot; &quot;Feeds&quot; and &quot;Cookies&quot; -- then &quot;Next.&quot; Pick a folder to export-- the umbrella &quot;Favorites&quot; exports all three -- then save the file to the drive by clicking &quot;Next&quot; one last time. The files will be &quot;bookmark.htm,&quot; &quot;feeds.opml&quot; and &quot;cookies.txt.&quot; Finally, copy those files to your backup destination. After upgrading, reverse the process by importing those files to the new copy of IE on Windows 7.

Note: The steps will be slightly different for other editions of IE. (Your passwords are exported to the cookies.txt file, by the way.)

For Firefox, it&apos;s even easier: Copy the &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\ username \Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles&quot; folder to your backup destination -- CD, DVD or online service -- then later copy that to the same location on Windows 7 after reinstalling Firefox. That will move all your bookmarks, site cookies and passwords to the just-upgraded PC.

You&apos;re on your own for other browsers. Hit your favorite search engine with strings like &quot; browser name migrate&quot; and find a solution that works for you. We did a quick search for &quot;Opera migrate,&quot; for example, and found these instructions .

Data safely secured. But what about the apps I&apos;m running? You&apos;ll have to reinstall all the software you plan to run on Windows 7, so gather all the installation discs you can find, as well as the activation or registration keys necessary to activate and use the software.

If you&apos;re running applications you&apos;ve downloaded from the Web, you&apos;ll need to make a list and dig up the activation/registration keys or codes. (You did save those, didn&apos;t you?) Most for-a-fee application developers send you an e-mail with the codes after you&apos;ve purchased and downloaded their software. If you&apos;ve been on top of things, you saved those e-mails.

If not..., root around each application for the screen that shows the code, and jot it down.

Some electronically-purchased software may reinstall on the refreshed PC only from the original downloads. If so -- it&apos;s more legwork, I know -- see if you can find them on the XP system. Add them to your data backup.

For free applications, the easiest way to get them on Windows 7 is to download them again from the upgraded machine. It&apos;s likely that there&apos;s a new version in any case, hopefully one compatible with the new OS. Add those apps to your list; later you can search using Google or Yahoo or Bing, then grab the app again.

Hint: Be smart, and compose your lists, including URLs, in an e-mail, then send it to a Web-based account. That way you can later pull up the e-mail and just click on the links. Saves typing time, and typo problems.

Do I have to reinstall every app I have on XP? Hardly. This is the perfect time, say experts, to cull the chaff. Those programs you rarely, if ever, use on XP don&apos;t have to make the move to Windows 7. Strike them off your to-do list.

This sounds like a lot of work. Isn&apos;t there an easier way? Yes, as long as you&apos;re ready to plunk down some cash.

One option is Laplink Software&apos;s PCmover Windows 7 Upgrade Assistant, a utility that promises to move virtually everything from Windows XP to Windows 7 during an upgrade on the same PC. Laplink is running a half-price special on the software, which allows one migration, until Thursday. The $14.95 program , regularly $29.95, can be downloaded from the company&apos;s site.

That&apos;s still work. Can I get someone to do the migration for me? Sure. Call a few local computer shops and ask whether they&apos;re doing Windows 7 upgrades, moving data transfer.

Or you can touch base with a New York company called iYogi, which bills itself as the &quot;fastest growing on-demand tech service&quot; in the country. iYogi offers several services for XP users who want to move up to Windows 7, including a $29.99 &quot;Windows 7 Professional Migration&quot; and a $39.99 &quot;Windows 7 Professional Migration.&quot; The former provides tools for retaining data and applications during the upgrade, while the latter promises that a Microsoft-certified technician will do it all for you via remote access.

More information is spelled out on iYogi&apos;s site ; the migration services won&apos;t be available until tomorrow.

    <body>* Second known H1N1 flu infection of turkeys

* Farm&apos;s birds, eggs have not entered food supply

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Turkeys in the Canadian province of Ontario have become infected with the H1N1 flu virus, but no birds or eggs from the farm entered the food supply, provincial government officials said on Tuesday.

The infection poses minimal risk to human health, Dr. Arlene King, Ontario&apos;s chief medical officer of health, said in a news conference in Toronto.

However, she noted the discovery highlights the need for those who work with farm animals to be vaccinated for both seasonal flu and the pandemic H1N1 flu strain.

The risk of the virus passing between people and animals is that the virus could evolve into a form against which humans have little or no immunity, King said. There is no evidence that the virus has changed, she added.

The discovery in a single Ontario barn by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is the second known incident of turkeys becoming infected with the H1N1 virus, also called swine flu. The first was in a flock in Chile.

The Ontario case comes just over a week after the Canadian Thanksgiving holiday, which traditionally involves a turkey dinner.

Health officials are following up with people who had contact with the infected turkeys. One person with contact had shown flu-like symptoms.

The turkeys&apos; owner has voluntarily agreed to quarantine the infected birds, but they aren&apos;t likely to be prematurely slaughtered, said Dr. Deb Stark, Ontario&apos;s chief veterinarian.

The outbreak of H1N1 flu among turkeys in Chile was discovered in August. It was also the first case of the virus being found outside humans and pigs [ID:nN20543933].

Earlier this year the strain was found in hog herds in the Western Canadian provinces of Alberta and Manitoba. (Reporting by Rod Nickel; editing by Rob Wilson)</body>

* Councils to temporarily shut schools in two provinces

BAGHDAD, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Iraq will temporarily shut down thousands of schools in two provinces and some in Baghdad after discovering 36 new cases of the H1N1 flu virus, Iraqi officials said on Tuesday.

Iraq&apos;s health ministry has discovered the flu in 22 secondary school girls and nine of their relatives in Wasit province, four students in Baghdad and a man in Dhi Kar province, General Director of Public Health Ihsan Jaafar said.

Provincial authorities in both provinces said they would briefly shut schools to prevent the virus&apos; spread. The officials said around 1,200 Wasit schools would close for a week and some 1,500 schools in Dhi Kar for 10 days from Wednesday.

Wasit officials said they would also close universities. In Baghdad, two schools have already been shut over the virus. In June, Iraq confirmed its first cases of the flu in members of the women&apos;s national basketball team.

Most people who catch the virus suffer mild symptoms, but H1N1 can be dangerous for some people with existing health conditions or otherwise healthy young adults. (Reporting by Aseel Kami and Khalid Farhan in Najaf; Editing by Angus MacSwan)</body>

Oct 20 (Reuters) - Vaccine maker Novavax Inc (NVAX.O) said it initiated a clinical study of its vaccine for H1N1 swine flu in Mexico in collaboration with Avimex Laboratories and GE Healthcare, sending its shares up 7 percent.

The pivotal study will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the virus-like-particle vaccine, Novavax said in a statement.

Avimex, which is funding the trial, is expected to market the vaccine in Mexico if approved, it said.

GE Healthcare will support the study by providing its single-use bioprocessing technologies for vaccine production.

Novavax shares were up 7 percent at $4.00 in pre-market trade. They closed at $3.75 Monday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Shailesh Kuber in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)</body>

* 12.8 million vaccines available (Adds Obama getting his flu shot, paragraph 13)

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Half of those hospitalized with the new H1N1 virus are under 25, a clear illustration that the pandemic is affecting the young disproportionately, U.S. health officials said on Tuesday.

They said reports from 27 U.S. states show 53 percent of people sick enough to be hospitalized with H1N1 flu are under the age of 25, with only 7 percent of hospitalizations among people 65 and older.

&quot;This is really, really different from what we see with seasonal flu,&quot; the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters. &quot;With seasonal flu, about 60 percent of hospitalizations occur in people 65 and over.

She stressed the report was incomplete but said if anything, it was underestimating the extent of the pandemic.

An analysis of 292 deaths from 28 states showed that younger people than usual are also dying, she said.

&quot;Almost a quarter of deaths are occurring in young people under the age of 25. Specifically, 23.6 percent of the deaths are in that age group. About 65 percent of the deaths are in people 25 to 64 years of age,&quot; Schuchat said.

Just 12 percent of deaths were among people over 65. In a normal year, 90 percent of those who die from flu are over 65.

With cooler weather, other viruses and infections are showing up, making the picture confusing.

Schuchat said influenza is being diagnosed in about 30 percent of all people showing up with &quot;influenza-like illness,&quot; symptoms that include cough, sore throat, fever and aches.

Almost all influenza is turning out to be H1N1 rather than seasonal influenza and Schuchat said the tests often miss cases of H1N1, so the percentage may be higher.

Ordinary colds, group A streptococcus, which causes &quot;strep throat&quot;, and other infections can cause similar symptoms.

The U.S. government is trying to vaccinate people against both seasonal influenza and H1N1 at the same time, making both vaccines available as manufacturers finish, bottle and get them approved batch by batch.

President Barack Obama received his seasonal influenza vaccine on Tuesday, according to a White House spokesman, who said he would &quot;wait his turn&quot; to get an H1N1 vaccine.

Five companies make both types for the U.S. market: Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) unit MedImmune.

Schuchat said H1N1 vaccine was becoming available slowly.

&quot;As of yesterday, 12.8 million doses were available for the states to order. More than half of that was available in the injectable form. So that&apos;s helpful, with giving us a variety of formulations,&quot; she said.

* Shares fall as much as 14 percent (Recasts; Adds details, updates share movement)

BANGALORE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - China&apos;s New Oriental Education and Technology Group Inc (EDU.N) posted lower-than-expected quarterly results as enrollments were hurt by the H1N1 flu pandemic, sending its shares down as much as 14 percent.

The company, which offers English language instruction and test preparation for English language exams, said it expects second-quarter enrollments to continue to be hurt by fears of the H1N1 flu.

New Oriental forecast second-quarter revenue between $60.8 million to $62.8 million.

Analysts were expecting revenue of $62 million for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company&apos;s revenue growth is likely seeing some impact from increased competition in the Chinese market, Signal Hill&apos;s analyst Jeff Lee said.

New Oriental launched a new learning program offering one-to-one tutoring and small class-size tutoring for 6-year to 18-year old students, in the first quarter.

Competition will be tougher in areas like middle or high school test preparations where the company has a less developed brand, analyst Brandon Dobbell from William Blair &amp; Co said.

Increased competition will mean that the company will have to spend more money on marketing, particularly in the big cities where the majority of its businesses are, he added.

FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS

For the first quarter ended Aug. 31, the company posted earnings of $57.1 million, or $1.47 per American Depositary Share (ADS), compared with $44.9 million, or $1.17 per ADS, a year earlier.

Revenue rose 26 percent to $149.4 million.

Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.57 a share on revenue of $154.6 million.

&quot;We estimate that the H1N1 flu pandemic negatively impacted our top line growth by 2-4 percent with a more significant negative percentage impact on our bottom line for the quarter,&quot; the company said in a statement.

Shares of the company fell as much as 14 percent to $70.11 before paring some losses to trade down $8.73 at $72.57 Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Amulya Nagaraj in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel and Unnikrishnan Nair)</body>

    <body>By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Sales of hand sanitizers, cleansers and face masks in the midst of the H1N1 flu pandemic may provide a profit boost this quarter, but are not expected to drive manufacturers&apos; results long-term.

Clorox Co (CLX.N), Ecolab Inc (ECL.N) and others have been in the spotlight since H1N1, or swine flu, was identified in the United States in April. With the flu season now in full swing, sales of their products have grown brisk.

Face masks and sanitizers have been used regularly in Asia since the outbreaks of SARS and Avian flu earlier this decade. In Japan and other countries, it is common to see people wearing masks if they have a cold.

In the United States, such practices are still rare but have become more common this year. Some travelers began donning face masks, flu shots have become more popular and hand sanitizing stations are popping up in office lobbies and other public spaces.

&quot;None of the companies are saying yet that they&apos;re going to see a lot of benefit, but I&apos;d argue that when you get into this quarter ... it will be one of the drivers of some of these people&apos;s numbers,&quot; said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj, who follows household products manufacturers.

&quot;If swine flu stays with us or the flu seasons broadly get worse, then this could be a longer-term benefit, but given what we know so far it seems like it&apos;s more of a short-term improvement,&quot; Dibadj said.

Among household products makers, Clorox and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) are seen as the biggest revenue beneficiaries. Margins could also improve if companies start running at fuller capacity to meet increased demand, Dibadj said.

At Clorox, the U.S. home and laundry business, which includes bleach and wipes, accounts for about 30 percent of sales.

Dibadj said Clorox could see a profit increase of up to 2 to 3 percent from swine flu &quot;if it gets pretty bad.&quot;

For Kimberly-Clark, healthcare items such as face masks are a small part of the total business. If sales of those items rose 10 percent, the company could see about 0.5 percent of profit lift, Dibadj estimated.

GROWTH ALREADY BEGAN

If the recent past is any indicator, manufacturers should see a lift this quarter, even as other parts of their businesses may still suffer amid the downturn.

One bright spot in Kimberly-Clark&apos;s second quarter was healthcare. Volume in that unit rose about 15 percent, driven by face masks. Overall company volume fell 2 percent.

3M Co (MMM.N) said strong demand for its respiratory masks in the second quarter helped offset sales declines in its industrial segment. Such growth has continued.

&quot;We have seen a significant increase in demand and we have increased our production,&quot; a 3M spokeswoman said.

The company, which also makes hand sanitizer, has been manufacturing face masks nonstop for a few months now.

Ecolab has &quot;seen a significant increase in orders for hand sanitizers in the third quarter and we expect that that will probably remain strong through the flu season,&quot; spokesman Michael Monahan said.

Ecolab has increased production three to five times for sanitizers such as Endure.

Chairman and CEO Douglas Baker, speaking during a July conference call, said a couple of million dollars in increased sales in its healthcare unit were thought to be tied to H1N1.

Still, less than 5 percent of revenue at the $6 billion company comes from products like hand sanitizers.

&quot;In the scheme of things it&apos;s immaterial to the bigger issues going on at companies,&quot; such as total revenue, foreign exchange fluctuations and commodity costs, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Jason Gere, who does not follow Ecolab. &quot;I think it will help but I don&apos;t think it will be all that material.&quot;

At Clorox, shipments of disinfecting wipes and bleach climbed in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in June.

&quot;It&apos;s a little bit more unclear about how consumers will respond this fall and winter, but we&apos;re definitely working with retail customers to ensure there is enough product,&quot; said Benno Dorer, senior vice president and general manager of Clorox&apos;s cleaning division.

Dorer declined to say if Clorox has taken steps such as shifting more plants to nonstop runs, or moving more production toward products in demand, such as bleach and wipes.

Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) did not discuss whether it saw a flu-related sales lift for Purell hand sanitizer in its third-quarter report. A spokesman declined to comment.

Others, however, have noted an increase. Alpha Pro Tech Ltd (APT.A), which has ramped up mask production, said mask sales would rise significantly in its third quarter, ended in September, and come in well ahead of the second quarter.

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc&apos;s (UNH.N) quarterly profit easily topped estimates on Tuesday as growth in its Medicare plans for seniors and drug benefit unit offset drags from the weak economy and the H1N1 flu.

Lower-than-expected medical costs, administrative expense controls and a tax gain also helped the largest U.S. health insurer by market value.

Shares rose 5.5 percent, even as UnitedHealth told analysts on a conference call it expected earnings to fall next year. The insurer expects continued enrollment losses for its employer-sponsored plans from the weak economy and faces lower government reimbursement for Medicare plans.

&quot;They beat the earnings expectations by a significant amount,&quot; Edward Jones analyst Steve Shubitz said. &quot;However, in 2010 you&apos;re going to see a very challenging year.&quot;

As the third-quarter earnings season starts, stock valuations of UnitedHealth and other health insurers remain at rock-bottom levels amid worries the health reform overhaul under debate in Washington will cripple future profits.

&quot;In normal times, we would expect a strongly positive stock reaction to these results,&quot; Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said in a research note.

&quot;However, the stock reaction here may be somewhat muted given uncertainty over the longer-term outlook as the push for health reform legislation continues in Congress.&quot;

UnitedHealth said net income rose 13 percent to $1.04 billion, or 89 cents per share, from $920 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average expected 76 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose about 8 percent to $21.7 billion, above the $21.56 billion analyst estimate.

Profit at the company&apos;s prescription drug benefit business more than doubled to $196 million, helped by higher prescription volume, gains in mail-order drug sales and a shift to higher-margin generics.

Revenue rose 19 percent at its Ovations business serving seniors to $7.9 billion. Its Medicare Advantage plans added 290,000 members to stand at 1.77 million at the end of September.

Total membership stood at 31.98 million at the end of September, down about 3 percent from a year earlier.

Since the end of June, its UnitedHealthcare commercial business serving employers declined by 275,000 members, including 195,000 in its more lucrative plans for which it assumes full insurance risk.

Like rivals, Minneapolis-based UnitedHealth said job cuts at its customers stemming from the weak economy was the overriding factor in the enrollment declines.

Medical costs accounted for 84.6 percent of premium revenue in the commercial business, compared to 83.8 percent a year ago. The company cited higher medical costs from the H1N1 flu and for benefits to people in so-called COBRA plans who have lost their jobs and tend to use more medical services.

Overall, 82 percent of premiums were spent on medical costs, compared to 81.7 percent a year ago, but still lower than the 83 percent expected by analysts at Goldman Sachs and Sanford Bernstein.

Operating costs as a percentage of revenue fell to 14.5 percent from 15 percent a year ago. A favorable resolution of state income tax items boosted earnings by 3 cents per share, the company said.

UnitedHealth projected 2009 earnings of about $3.15 per share, compared to its previous view of $3 to $3.15. Analysts expect $3.09.

For next year, the company projected earnings of $2.90 to $3.10 per share on revenue of around $89 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings $3.16 per share on revenue of $91.5 billion.

&quot;We expect 2010 to be a somewhat more difficult year than 2009,&quot; Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley told analysts on a conference call.

UnitedHealth shares rose $1.36 to $26.28 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Monday, they had fallen 6 percent this year, underperforming a 3 percent rise for the S&amp;P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO of large health insurers.

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - More than 100 new cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy got infected with swine flu at a July 4 barbecue and fireworks display but quick isolation measures got it under control within two weeks, researchers reported on Tuesday.

The outbreak provided a unique opportunity to study the virus closely and Dr. Catherine Takacs Witkop and colleagues say they discovered some surprising things. Among them:

* Nearly a quarter, or 24 percent, of patients still had virus in their noses seven days after getting sick, including 19 percent who had been well for at least 24 hours

* Tamiflu, the drug used to treat influenza, did not help any of the previously healthy young men and women get better any quicker.

* Most cadets were sick for five days or longer

* Eleven percent of the cadets became infected.

In June, soon after the new H1N1 virus was declared a pandemic, 1,376 new cadets arrived for their first training at the academy, near Colorado Springs, Colorado. By July 24, 134 confirmed and 33 suspected cases were identified, Witkop&apos;s team reported in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The cadets, unusually young and healthy, all did well and none became seriously ill or died. Most cases were traced to a July 4 party for the cadets, Witkop said.

&quot;It was about 48 to 72 hours later that we saw the increase in the cadets presenting with the symptoms,&quot; Witkop said in a telephone interview.

Witkop said the academy doctors quickly designated one dormitory for the sick cadets and kept them away from the others.

They tested them daily for the virus, painting a picture of the course of the disease far more detailed than has been possible before.

IN THE NOSE

Eleven, or 19 percent, of nose washes taken from 58 patients who had been free of symptoms for a full 24 hours still contained virus, although it is not clear if the patients were still contagious. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that H1N1 patients can return to work and school 24 hours after their symptoms such as fever go away.

The CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said researchers know people, especially children, can carry the virus long after they are better. &quot;Shedding doesn&apos;t mean you are spreading,&quot; Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing. &quot;Fever is a good marker of infectiousness or ability to spread.&quot;

Many of the cadets were treated with oseltamivir, pills sold by Roche AG (ROG.VX) under the Tamiflu brand name, but they did not get better any more quickly than untreated cadets.

&quot;We did use it in the hope that we would stem the tide of the outbreak but I don&apos;t think the Tamiflu was the key player in the outreak resolution,&quot; Witkop said.

&quot;I think it was ... the isolation protocol,&quot; she added. Cadets stayed in the sick dorm until they were free of symptoms for 24 hours, or for seven days after first getting sick, whichever was longer.

The CDC recommends saving Tamiflu for people most at risk of getting severely ill from flu, such as pregnant women, people with diabetes or asthma or disabled children.

The academy also quickly educated the cadets about washing hands and not spreading germs by covering their coughs, and Witkop said they used a great deal of hand sanitizer, which may have helped control the outbreak within 10 to 14 days.

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc&apos;s (UNH.N) quarterly profit easily topped estimates on Tuesday as growth in its Medicare plans for seniors and drug benefit unit offset drags from the weak economy and the H1N1 flu.

Lower-than-expected medical costs, administrative expense controls and a tax gain also helped the largest U.S. health insurer by market value.

Shares rose 5.5 percent, even as UnitedHealth told analysts on a conference call it expected earnings to fall next year. The insurer expects continued enrollment losses for its employer-sponsored plans from the weak economy and faces lower government reimbursement for Medicare plans.

&quot;They beat the earnings expectations by a significant amount,&quot; Edward Jones analyst Steve Shubitz said. &quot;However, in 2010 you&apos;re going to see a very challenging year.&quot;

(Adds conference call, analyst comments, shares)

PARIS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - French medical diagnostics company BioMerieux (BIOX.PA) raised its 2009 operating margin forecast after a jump in third-quarter sales, helped by tests to detect swine flu and a recovery of demand in the U.S.

BioMerieux expects its margin before non-recurring items to be &quot;above&quot; instead of &quot;about&quot; 17 percent, as North American demand for its instruments returns to growth after laboratory investment tumbled during the credit crisis.

It still sees growth in like-for-like sales, excluding currency swings, takeovers and divestments, of between 5 and 7 percent this year, not taking into account the favourable impact on revenue of swine flu test sales, BioMerieux said.

&quot;During the quarter, instrument sales in North America returned to growth for the first time since fourth-quarter 2007 and global sales of industrial applications rose by nearly 10 percent,&quot; Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said in a statement on Tuesday.

Third-quarter sales rose 12.8 percent, or 11.2 percent like-for-like, to 305.9 million euros ($457 million). They grew 12 percent, or 7.8 percent like-for-like, in the first nine months of the year to 895 million.

Analysts said sales growth beat consensus forecasts, lifting BioMerieux shares by as much as 3.1 percent shortly after the stock market opened. The stock was up 2.9 percent at 79.67 euros at 0706 GMT, giving it a market value of 3.14 billion euros.

The H1N1 flu pandemic helped lift sales of tests like QuickVue. Excluding this impact, like-for-like growth was an estimated 9 percent in the third quarter and 6.7 percent over the first nine months.

Head of finance Henri Thomasson reiterated on a conference call that BioMerieux would probably announce acquisitions this year and that the focus was chiefly on the United States, India and China, where sales grew 26 percent in the first nine months.

He declined to indicate the possible size or nature of the acquisitions. Debt stood at 22 million euros on Sept. 30.

BioMerieux makes and sells tests -- re-agents, instruments or software -- for disease detection. Competitors include Qiagen (QGEN.DE), Becton Dickinson (BDX.N) and Invitrogen IVGN.O.

So far this year, it has launched 11 new products, including a molecular biology test that can help improve the care of HIV+ patients or the VIDAS EBV that detects the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis, commonly known as kissing disease.

&quot;We continue to believe that BioMerieux&apos;s diversified business offers a source of stability in current markets,&quot; Jefferies European Healthcare Research said in a note.

&quot;However, the shares appear fully valued and we would not buy at current levels,&quot; it said, adding that the stock was trading broadly in line with its peers, at 22 times estimated 2009 earnings per share (EPS) and 19 times 2010 EPS.

    <body>* Pigs were at state fair where four teens got sick

* USDA says no direct link with H1N1 human outbreak

* USDA says preliminary positives in three swine (adds preliminary positives in three swine, paragraph 2)

By Christopher Doering and Charles Abbott

WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. hog has tested positive for the pandemic H1N1 flu virus for the first time ever, the Agriculture Department confirmed on Monday.

USDA said the virus was found in a hog exhibited at the Minnesota State Fair where four teenagers became sick.

The discovery does not suggest infection of commercial pig herds raised for slaughter, USDA said. So far, it said, preliminary positives have been found in three hogs with tests confirming pandemic H1N1 on one of them.

Health officials say the virus, originally known as swine flu, is not linked to meat products.

&quot;People cannot get this flu from eating pork or pork products. Pork is safe to eat,&quot; Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.

Swine flu, common in hogs around the world, causes fever and coughing in pigs, which usually recover from the illness. The virus has been found in several herds in Canada. [ID:nN02544902]

The new H1N1 virus, which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June, is circulating the globe and is widespread among people in 41 U.S. states.

Vilsack said &quot;we have fully engaged our trading partners to remind them&quot; that livestock experts say there is no reason to restrict trade.

Seven countries, including China, already had bans in place against U.S. pork. Vilsack, who is scheduled to visit China on Oct. 28 and 29 for routine trade discussions, said last week he would urge China to end its restrictions on U.S. beef and pork.

&quot;We certainly are concerned,&quot; said Dave Warner of the National Pork Producers Council, about the potential of new bans.

U.S. hog futures &lt;0#LH:&gt; turned lower near midday on Monday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but traders blamed weak cash hog and pork markets, rather than the news that the U.S. hog contracted H1N1 flu. [ID:nN19378822]

Additional samples from the Minnesota State Fair are being tested, USDA said. Samples were taken from Aug. 26 to Sept. 1 as part of a research project that documents flu viruses in settings where people and hogs interact.

USDA&apos;s National Veterinary Services Laboratories used three tests to confirm the presence of the virus in a pig sample.

Detection in the hog at the state fair does not suggest commercial herds are infected, said USDA, because show pigs and commercial herds are separate parts of the swine industry and usually do not mix.

The Minnesota State Fair, which ended Sept. 6, sent 120 teens home on Sept. 3 after four of them were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. The teens were members of a performing arts group in 4-H, a nationwide social and educational program for rural youth.

On Friday, USDA said &quot;information available at this time would suggest the children were not sickened by contact with the fair pigs.&quot; It said the hogs appeared healthy when the samples were taken. A USDA source said it appeared some of the children handling the swine were showing signs of the flu.

A meat industry group, the American Meat Institute, said it &quot;is not unexpected&quot; for the pandemic H1N1 virus to be discovered in U.S. hogs. It said experts &quot;have underscored that novel H1N1 is not a foodborne disease; it is a respiratory infection that does not impact pork safety.&quot;

According to the World Health Organization, fewer than 5,000 people have died from H1N1, also known as swine flu, this year. WHO said influenza activity in the northern hemisphere was much higher than usual.

Most people who catch the H1N1 virus suffer mild symptoms.

But in contrast to seasonal flu strains, which can be serious for elderly people, H1N1 can turn dangerous for some people with existing health conditions or otherwise healthy young adults. (Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton and Bob Burgdorfer in Chicago; Editing by David Gregorio)</body>

WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. hog has tested positive for the pandemic H1N1 flu virus for the first time ever, the Agriculture Department confirmed on Monday.

USDA said the virus was found in a hog exhibited at the Minnesota State Fair where four teenagers became sick.

The discovery does not suggest infection of commercial pig herds raised for slaughter, USDA said. So far, it said, preliminary positives have been found in three hogs with tests confirming pandemic H1N1 on one of them.

Health officials say the virus, originally known as swine flu, is not linked to meat products.

&quot;People cannot get this flu from eating pork or pork products. Pork is safe to eat,&quot; Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.

The new H1N1 virus, which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June, is circulating the globe and is widespread among people in 41 U.S. states.

Vilsack said &quot;we have fully engaged our trading partners to remind them&quot; that livestock experts say there is no reason to restrict trade.

Seven countries, including China, already had bans in place against U.S. pork. Vilsack, who is scheduled to visit China on Oct. 28 and 29 for routine trade discussions, said last week he would urge China to end its restrictions on U.S. beef and pork.

&quot;We certainly are concerned,&quot; said Dave Warner of the National Pork Producers Council, about the potential of new bans.

U.S. hog futures &lt;0#LH:&gt; turned lower near midday on Monday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but traders blamed weak cash hog and pork markets, rather than the news that the U.S. hog contracted H1N1 flu. [ID:nN19378822]

Additional samples from the Minnesota State Fair are being tested, USDA said. Samples were taken from Aug. 26 to Sept. 1 as part of a research project that documents flu viruses in settings where people and hogs interact.

USDA&apos;s National Veterinary Services Laboratories used three tests to confirm the presence of the virus in a pig sample.

Detection in the hog at the state fair does not suggest commercial herds are infected, said USDA, because show pigs and commercial herds are separate parts of the swine industry and usually do not mix.

The Minnesota State Fair, which ended Sept. 6, sent 120 teens home on Sept. 3 after four of them were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. The teens were members of a performing arts group in 4-H, a nationwide social and educational program for rural youth.

    <body>By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Monday she does not expect the H1N1 flu pandemic to have a larger than usual effect on the U.S. economy.

But the government make review flu vaccine manufacturing, which is based on 50-year-old technology, she said.

So far the pandemic is not expected to have &quot;an undue economic impact beyond what you normally have with flu,&quot; Napolitano told the Reuters Washington Summit.

Napolitano, one of President Barack Obama&apos;s top advisers on the pandemic, provided no estimates. But she predicted the economy and other factors, including vaccine production, will ultimately form the basis for a broad H1N1 review.

&quot;Once we are through this season and we can see what has actually happened, and what the clinical picture was like ... what the impact on the economy, if any, was like, then there will be time and should be time for a review,&quot; she said.

&quot;This has been a massive enterprise. It has involved thousands of people and billions of dollars,&quot; she said.

The U.S. government is in the midst of a $6.4 billion mass immunization program against swine flu, the first American initiative of its kind in a generation.

The government has bought vaccine from five makers who also make seasonal flu vaccine -- AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Pasteur (SASY.PA), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and CSL (CSL.AX).

Health officials expect to make available up to 250 million doses of vaccine by the end of 2009 but have predicted bumps in the road and last week announced that vaccine production goals for October could be off by as much as 25-30 percent.

The problem lies in getting chicken eggs to yield vaccine. It took five months to make the vaccine against H1N1.

The U.S. government is helping to fund companies working on faster, better technologies but progress has been slow. The ultimate goal is a universal influenza vaccine that would protect against all strains.

&quot;I think there should be and will be an after-action review and that will necessarily entail revisiting the issue of how flu vaccine is conceived and manufactured,&quot; Napolitano said.

A typical seasonal flu season in the United States can kill 36,000 people, mainly the elderly. But H1N1 poses a greater danger to children and young adults and health officials say it may infect more people because so few have any immunity to it.

Estimates on flu&apos;s economic impact are more difficult to compile and can vary greatly.

But the World Bank said in July that a flu pandemic could trigger global GDP losses of 0.7 to 4.8 percentage points, depending on severity.

Regionally, official surveys suggested losses of 1.5 to 5 percentage points in U.S. gross domestic product, 2.6 to 6.8 percentage points in Asia and 1.6 to 3.3 percentage points for the European Union.

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - There is nothing unique or scary about the new H1N1 swine flu vaccine that should keep people from getting it, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said on Monday.

He said the H1N1 vaccine is made in exactly the same way as seasonal flu vaccine, and by the very same companies.

Yet fears about its safety -- some fostered by media accounts and personalities -- are raising undue worry.

&quot;The concerns that there might be something unique and scary about this are utterly unjustified,&quot; Collins said in an interview at the Society of Neuroscience meeting in Chicago.

&quot;I would say this is a remarkably safe and effective vaccine,&quot; he said, noting that the risks &quot;are about as close to zero as we can measure.&quot;

He said the H1N1 pandemic is now widespread in the United States. &quot;It&apos;s upon us. There is no part of the country where it is not present in various degrees,&quot; he said.

&quot;Any notion that this was an unnecessary response is fading away pretty quickly,&quot; said Collins, a genetics pioneer who in July was tapped by President Barack Obama to head the NIH.

He told reporters at the meeting that his first few months as NIH director have been like &quot;a boy drinking from a fire hose,&quot; referring to the deluge of proposals from scientists hoping to win some of the $5 billion in medical and scientific funding set aside from the $787 billion economic stimulus package.

While that will go a long way toward easing pent-up demand for funding of scientific research, he said his agency could face a steep drop in the fiscal year 2011 budget unless the economy begins to rebound.

&quot;It&apos;s going to be tough, and anybody who has not realized the reality here needs to be prepared for what could be a very difficult time,&quot; he said.

Collins said NIH will continue to fund basic science, but he also hopes to support the use of powerful new research tools, including new imaging technologies and genomics -- studying the DNA map to find causes of diseases.

He also hopes to support the use of powerful computers to make medical discoveries and nanotechnology, the design and manipulation of ultra-tiny materials.

Collins said NIH will also play a role in health care reform by providing studies that give policymakers better evidence on which to base their decision making.

He said the NIH will conduct more studies that compare the effectiveness of therapies, but also on how different drugs affect different people based on their genetic makeup.

Collins said his pet project is to devote more resources to research in rare diseases, which often do not get much exploration by drug companies.

&quot;This would not be to compete with biotech and pharma, but basically to de-risk projects that currently don&apos;t attract real investments because they are too risky,&quot; Collins said.

&quot;The potential here is to speed up developments for disease that otherwise get very little attention as far as treatment,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;The science is ready to do this.&quot;

    <body>OTTAWA (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc has shipped two million doses of H1N1 vaccines to Canada&apos;s provinces and more will be sent this week, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said on Monday.

She said the vaccines would be offered to the public once clinical trials have been concluded and the federal regulator gives its approval.

Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said he expected the public roll out to begin as expected in the first week of November.

&quot;A handful of countries may have access to some vaccine for some of their citizens before we do. However, we will have vaccines available for every Canadian who needs and wants it,&quot; he told a news conference with Aglukkaq.

Butler-Jones said 3 million doses or more would be sent out every week. Canada has a population of 33.7 million and has ordered 50.4 million doses from GlaxoSmithKline.

Opposition politicians have criticized the government for not starting vaccinations earlier, but Butler-Jones said Canada followed World Health Organization recommendations in beginning H1N1 vaccine production immediately after seasonal flu vaccine production was complete.

WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. hog has tested positive for the pandemic H1N1 flu virus for the first time ever, the Agriculture Department confirmed on Monday.

USDA said the virus was found in a hog exhibited at the Minnesota State Fair where four teenagers became sick.

The discovery does not suggest infection of commercial pig herds raised for slaughter, USDA said. So far, it said, preliminary positives have been found in three hogs with tests confirming pandemic H1N1 on one of them.

On Friday, USDA said &quot;information available at this time would suggest the children were not sickened by contact with the fair pigs.&quot; It said the hogs appeared healthy when the samples were taken. A USDA source said it appeared some of the children handling the swine were showing signs of the flu.

A meat industry group, the American Meat Institute, said it &quot;is not unexpected&quot; for the pandemic H1N1 virus to be discovered in U.S. hogs. It said experts &quot;have underscored that novel H1N1 is not a foodborne disease; it is a respiratory infection that does not impact pork safety.&quot;

According to the World Health Organization, fewer than 5,000 people have died from H1N1, also known as swine flu, this year. WHO said influenza activity in the northern hemisphere was much higher than usual.

Most people who catch the H1N1 virus suffer mild symptoms.

But in contrast to seasonal flu strains, which can be serious for elderly people, H1N1 can turn dangerous for some people with existing health conditions or otherwise healthy young adults.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Monday she does not expect the H1N1 flu pandemic to have a larger than usual effect on the U.S. economy.

But the government make review flu vaccine manufacturing, which is based on 50-year-old technology, she said.

So far the pandemic is not expected to have &quot;an undue economic impact beyond what you normally have with flu,&quot; Napolitano told the Reuters Washington Summit.

Napolitano, one of President Barack Obama&apos;s top advisers on the pandemic, provided no estimates. But she predicted the economy and other factors, including vaccine production, will ultimately form the basis for a broad H1N1 review.

&quot;Once we are through this season and we can see what has actually happened, and what the clinical picture was like ... what the impact on the economy, if any, was like, then there will be time and should be time for a review,&quot; she said.

&quot;This has been a massive enterprise. It has involved thousands of people and billions of dollars,&quot; she said.

The U.S. government is in the midst of a $6.4 billion mass immunization program against swine flu, the first American initiative of its kind in a generation.

The government has bought vaccine from five makers who also make seasonal flu vaccine -- AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Pasteur (SASY.PA), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and CSL (CSL.AX).

Health officials expect to make available up to 250 million doses of vaccine by the end of 2009 but have predicted bumps in the road and last week announced that vaccine production goals for October could be off by as much as 25-30 percent.

The problem lies in getting chicken eggs to yield vaccine. It took five months to make the vaccine against H1N1.

The U.S. government is helping to fund companies working on faster, better technologies but progress has been slow. The ultimate goal is a universal influenza vaccine that would protect against all strains.

&quot;I think there should be and will be an after-action review and that will necessarily entail revisiting the issue of how flu vaccine is conceived and manufactured,&quot; Napolitano said.

A typical seasonal flu season in the United States can kill 36,000 people, mainly the elderly. But H1N1 poses a greater danger to children and young adults and health officials say it may infect more people because so few have any immunity to it.

Estimates on flu&apos;s economic impact are more difficult to compile and can vary greatly.

But the World Bank said in July that a flu pandemic could trigger global GDP losses of 0.7 to 4.8 percentage points, depending on severity.

Regionally, official surveys suggested losses of 1.5 to 5 percentage points in U.S. gross domestic product, 2.6 to 6.8 percentage points in Asia and 1.6 to 3.3 percentage points for the European Union.

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - There is nothing unique or scary about the new H1N1 swine flu vaccine that should keep people from getting it, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said on Monday.

He said the H1N1 vaccine is made in exactly the same way as seasonal flu vaccine, and by the very same companies.

Yet fears about its safety -- some fostered by media accounts and personalities -- are raising undue worry.

&quot;The concerns that there might be something unique and scary about this are utterly unjustified,&quot; Collins said in an interview at the Society of Neuroscience meeting in Chicago.

&quot;I would say this is a remarkably safe and effective vaccine,&quot; he said, noting that the risks &quot;are about as close to zero as we can measure.&quot;

He said the H1N1 pandemic is now widespread in the United States. &quot;It&apos;s upon us. There is no part of the country where it is not present in various degrees,&quot; he said.

&quot;Any notion that this was an unnecessary response is fading away pretty quickly,&quot; said Collins, a genetics pioneer who in July was tapped by President Barack Obama to head the NIH.

He told reporters at the meeting that his first few months as NIH director have been like &quot;a boy drinking from a fire hose,&quot; referring to the deluge of proposals from scientists hoping to win some of the $5 billion in medical and scientific funding set aside from the $787 billion economic stimulus package.

While that will go a long way toward easing pent-up demand for funding of scientific research, he said his agency could face a steep drop in the fiscal year 2011 budget unless the economy begins to rebound.

&quot;It&apos;s going to be tough, and anybody who has not realized the reality here needs to be prepared for what could be a very difficult time,&quot; he said.

Collins said NIH will continue to fund basic science, but he also hopes to support the use of powerful new research tools, including new imaging technologies and genomics -- studying the DNA map to find causes of diseases.

He also hopes to support the use of powerful computers to make medical discoveries and nanotechnology, the design and manipulation of ultra-tiny materials.

Collins said NIH will also play a role in health care reform by providing studies that give policymakers better evidence on which to base their decision making.

He said the NIH will conduct more studies that compare the effectiveness of therapies, but also on how different drugs affect different people based on their genetic makeup.

Collins said his pet project is to devote more resources to research in rare diseases, which often do not get much exploration by drug companies.

&quot;This would not be to compete with biotech and pharma, but basically to de-risk projects that currently don&apos;t attract real investments because they are too risky,&quot; Collins said.

&quot;The potential here is to speed up developments for disease that otherwise get very little attention as far as treatment,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;The science is ready to do this.&quot;

    <body>OTTAWA (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc has shipped two million doses of H1N1 vaccines to Canada&apos;s provinces and more will be sent this week, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said on Monday.

She said the vaccines would be offered to the public once clinical trials have been concluded and the federal regulator gives its approval.

Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said he expected the public roll out to begin as expected in the first week of November.

&quot;A handful of countries may have access to some vaccine for some of their citizens before we do. However, we will have vaccines available for every Canadian who needs and wants it,&quot; he told a news conference with Aglukkaq.

Butler-Jones said 3 million doses or more would be sent out every week. Canada has a population of 33.7 million and has ordered 50.4 million doses from GlaxoSmithKline.

Opposition politicians have criticized the government for not starting vaccinations earlier, but Butler-Jones said Canada followed World Health Organization recommendations in beginning H1N1 vaccine production immediately after seasonal flu vaccine production was complete.

    <body>By Christopher Doering and Charles Abbott

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. hog has tested positive for the pandemic H1N1 flu virus for the first time ever, the Agriculture Department confirmed on Monday.

USDA said the virus was found in a hog exhibited at the Minnesota State Fair where four teenagers became sick.

The discovery does not suggest infection of commercial pig herds raised for slaughter, USDA said. So far, it said, preliminary positives have been found in three hogs with tests confirming pandemic H1N1 on one of them.

Health officials say the virus, originally known as swine flu, is not linked to meat products.

&quot;People cannot get this flu from eating pork or pork products. Pork is safe to eat,&quot; Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.

Swine flu, common in hogs around the world, causes fever and coughing in pigs, which usually recover from the illness. The virus has been found in several herds in Canada.

The new H1N1 virus, which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June, is circulating the globe and is widespread among people in 41 U.S. states.

Vilsack said &quot;we have fully engaged our trading partners to remind them&quot; that livestock experts say there is no reason to restrict trade.

Seven countries, including China, already had bans in place against U.S. pork. Vilsack, who is scheduled to visit China on October 28 and 29 for routine trade discussions, said last week he would urge China to end its restrictions on U.S. beef and pork.

&quot;We certainly are concerned,&quot; said Dave Warner of the National Pork Producers Council, about the potential of new bans.

U.S. hog futures turned lower near midday on Monday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but traders blamed weak cash hog and pork markets, rather than the news that the U.S. hog contracted H1N1 flu.

Additional samples from the Minnesota State Fair are being tested, USDA said. Samples were taken from August 26 to September 1 as part of a research project that documents flu viruses in settings where people and hogs interact.

USDA&apos;s National Veterinary Services Laboratories used three tests to confirm the presence of the virus in a pig sample.

Detection in the hog at the state fair does not suggest commercial herds are infected, said USDA, because show pigs and commercial herds are separate parts of the swine industry and usually do not mix.

The Minnesota State Fair, which ended September 6, sent 120 teens home on September 3 after four of them were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. The teens were members of a performing arts group in 4-H, a nationwide social and educational program for rural youth.

On Friday, USDA said &quot;information available at this time would suggest the children were not sickened by contact with the fair pigs.&quot; It said the hogs appeared healthy when the samples were taken. A USDA source said it appeared some of the children handling the swine were showing signs of the flu.

It said experts &quot;have underscored that novel H1N1 is not a foodborne disease; it is a respiratory infection that does not impact pork safety.&quot;

According to the World Health Organization, fewer than 5,000 people have died from H1N1, also known as swine flu, this year. WHO said influenza activity in the northern hemisphere was much higher than usual.

Most people who catch the H1N1 virus suffer mild symptoms.

But in contrast to seasonal flu strains, which can be serious for elderly people, H1N1 can turn dangerous for some people with existing health conditions or otherwise healthy young adults.

Patients who become severely sick with the new H1N1 swine flu virus, which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June, often need to be put on ventilators.

The CDC ordered a total of 4,500 of CareFusion&apos;s LTV 1200 ventilators for the national stockpile, which is the nation&apos;s reserve of medical products used in the event that local supplies are depleted during a severe public health emergency. (Reporting by Susan Kelly)</body>

    <body>WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. government this week warned against the online marketing of unlicensed health remedies claiming to protect against H1N1 swine flu infection, including fake &quot;Tamiflu&quot; pills from India.

The Food and Drug Administration reported on Thursday that it had purchased and analyzed several products represented on the Internet as Tamiflu, Roche Holding AG&apos;s brand name (ROG.VX) version of the antiviral drug oseltamivir.

One order, which arrived in an unmarked envelope from India, consisted of unlabeled white pills that contained talc and the common pain reliever acetaminophen, the FDA said. Others contained various amounts of oseltamivir but were not approved for use in the United States.

In one action, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission ordered well-known author and doctor Andrew Weil to stop marketing his Immune Support Formula to protect against the H1N1 flu virus.

&quot;Claims that a dietary supplement can prevent, treat or cure human infection with the H1N1 virus must be supported by well-controlled human clinical studies,&quot; the regulatory agencies said in a warning letter to Weil.

Officials at Weil&apos;s Phoenix, Arizona-based headquarters were not immediately available for comment.

&quot;Products that are offered for sale online with claims to diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat or cure the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus must be carefully evaluated,&quot; FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said in a statement.

Swine flu, which emerged in March, spread quickly around the world, and was declared a pandemic in June, poses a serious health threat because most people lack immunity to it.

But U.S. health officials say the most effective protection against infection is vaccination and the federal government hopes to offer as many as 250 million vaccine doses to the public by the end of the year.

The government has ordered vaccine from five companies -- Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) unit MedImmune.

Once someone is already infected, oseltamivir and another antiviral drug called zanamivir -- an inhaled medicine produced as Relenza by GlaxoSmithKline Plc can help relieve the severity of disease.

Widespread and unnecessary use threatens to make the H1N1 virus resistant to the antivirals, which would render them ineffective as medicine for people with severe flu cases.

    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department said on Friday it was testing for the H1N1 flu virus in samples from hogs at the Minnesota State Fair, where there was an outbreak of the flu among teenagers in a dormitory.

There is &quot;no direct link&quot; between the outbreak and the hogs, said USDA. &quot;Information available at this time would suggest the children were not sickened by contact with the fair pigs.&quot;

Fair officials sent 120 teens home on September 3 after four of them were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. The teens were members of a 4-H performing arts group.

USDA said it appeared some of the children handling the swine were showing signs of the flu.

The hogs appeared healthy when the samples were collected from August 26 through September 1 as part of a research project funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The project documents flu viruses in settings, such as fairs, where people and hogs are present.

Results of the tests on the hog samples could be available as early as Saturday, said a USDA source. He said officials were looking at samples from two hogs, which probably were sent to market after the fair.

&quot;I don&apos;t think there should be any repercussions after or additional tests or trace or anything regardless of the results,&quot; said the source.

In a statement, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said, &quot;I want to remind people that people cannot get this flu from eating pork or pork products.&quot;

According to the World Health Organization, fewer than 5,000 people have died from H1N1, also known as swine flu, this year. WHO said influenza activity in the Northern Hemisphere was much higher than usual.

Most people who catch the H1N1 virus suffer mild symptoms.

But in contrast to seasonal flu strains which can be serious for elderly people, H1N1 can turn dangerous for some people with existing health conditions or otherwise healthy young adults.

GENEVA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - H1N1 pandemic influenza remains a cause for concern because of its unpredictable nature, even though it has killed fewer than 5,000 people so far this year, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

A statement from the United Nations health agency said that more than 4,735 deaths attributable to H1N1, known as swine flu, had been reported, and that influenza activity in the northern hemisphere was much higher than usual.

But WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from the death toll as experts needed to monitor a full year of the disease, which the WHO declared a pandemic in June after the strain was first detected in April.

&quot;Although the death rate might not be enormous at the moment we do have to continue to be prepared for developments as we go through the winter in the northern hemisphere,&quot; Hartl said.

In particular, health experts need to observe the behaviour of the virus during the traditional January-February peak of the influenza season in the northern hemisphere, he told a briefing.

Most people who catch the H1N1 virus suffer mild symptoms.

But in contrast to seasonal flu strains which can be serious for elderly people, H1N1 can turn dangerous for some people with existing health conditions or otherwise healthy young adults.

&quot;There is a small subset of cases that do and can progress quite rapidly to severe disease and this is sometimes in the space of less than 24 hours and it then becomes a big, big challenge to save the people,&quot; Hartl said.

&quot;This disease continues to cause concern because it doesn&apos;t act exactly like seasonal influenza and because it doesn&apos;t affect the same groups who are affected by seasonal influenza.&quot; (For the WHO statement go to link.reuters.com/keq34f ) (Reporting by Jonathan Lynn; Editing by Jon Boyle)</body>

GENEVA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - H1N1 pandemic influenza remains a cause for concern because of its unpredictable nature, even though it has killed fewer than 5,000 people so far this year, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

A statement from the United Nations health agency said that more than 4,735 deaths attributable to H1N1, known as swine flu, had been reported, and that influenza activity in the northern hemisphere was much higher than usual.

But WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from the death toll as experts needed to monitor a full year of the disease, which the WHO declared a pandemic in June after the strain was first detected in April.

&quot;Although the death rate might not be enormous at the moment we do have to continue to be prepared for developments as we go through the winter in the northern hemisphere,&quot; Hartl said.

In particular, health experts need to observe the behaviour of the virus during the traditional January-February peak of the influenza season in the northern hemisphere, he told a briefing.

Most people who catch the H1N1 virus suffer mild symptoms.

But in contrast to seasonal flu strains which can be serious for elderly people, H1N1 can turn dangerous for some people with existing health conditions or otherwise healthy young adults.

&quot;There is a small subset of cases that do and can progress quite rapidly to severe disease and this is sometimes in the space of less than 24 hours and it then becomes a big, big challenge to save the people,&quot; Hartl said.

&quot;This disease continues to cause concern because it doesn&apos;t act exactly like seasonal influenza and because it doesn&apos;t affect the same groups who are affected by seasonal influenza.&quot; (For the WHO statement go to link.reuters.com/keq34f ) (Reporting by Jonathan Lynn; Editing by Jon Boyle)</body>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government&apos;s $6.4 billion swine flu vaccination program is likely to put the American public health sector under unprecedented strain and expose serious shortcomings, experts say.

As the first mass U.S. immunization program in a generation ramps up to deliver tens of millions of doses each week, public health experts disagree about how well the country&apos;s network of state and local health departments might perform.

But many say the sector never received the money it needed for large-scale immunizations despite years of planning for pandemics after the reemergence of bird flu in Hong Kong and South Korea in 2003.

&quot;The worst-case scenario is that there is vaccine in a particular state or locale but that state or locale hasn&apos;t sufficiently planned to distribute it,&quot; said Leonard Marcus of the Harvard School of Public Health.

Marcus, who studied the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster, said the H1N1 immunization program could encounter similar breakdowns in leadership and coordination wherever local public health systems are underfunded or poorly managed.

&quot;Some bureaucrat is going to say he doesn&apos;t have authority or needs a signature and it&apos;s going to stop the system from moving. That could very well cause panic,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.

Experts give the Obama administration high marks for creating a program capable of procuring 250 million doses and distributing them to 90,000 sites nationwide so that every American who wants the vaccine can get it.

The government has ordered vaccine from five companies -- Sanofi-Aventis SA, CSL Ltd, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline and the AstraZeneca unit MedImmune.

&quot;RUSTY FAUCET&quot;

Bob Hutchens, a vaccine distribution expert with consulting firm Booz &amp; Co, expects overall success.

&quot;There will be some long lines, there may need to be some late hours and people may not be able to get it the day they want it,&quot; he said. &quot;But if we approach this soundly and rationally, I suspect we&apos;ll be just fine.&quot;

But with the United States struggling to recover from an economic recession, staffing could be an issue.

Local health departments eliminated 8,000 positions in the first half of this year, after 7,000 job cuts in 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Another 12,000 employees have been subjected to reduced hours or mandatory furloughs this year.

The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials says three-quarters of states have cut public health funding this year, while 61 percent expect smaller budgets in 2010. Seven states have cut back specifically on immunization.

Layoffs have targeted people needed for the H1N1 program -- nurses, nurse&apos;s aides and switchboard operators and receptionists who would help field public queries.

&quot;The problem is that there&apos;s a big rusty faucet at the end of the vaccine pipeline,&quot; said the University of Minnesota&apos;s Michael Osterholm, who warns public fears could flare quickly if H1N1 overwhelms hospitals and their intensive care units.

A poll by the American College of Emergency Physicians says almost 90 percent of emergency room doctors worry hospitals could have a hard time responding to a surge in H1N1 flu.

&quot;Public health is the life raft,&quot; Osterholm said. &quot;But are they big enough to get everybody on board and how will they navigate those rough waters?&quot;

Experts were careful not to criticize the caliber of public health staff, widely respected for their energy and devotion.

But they said meager resources, combined with the scale and speed of the national immunization program, will bring unprecedented strains.

FRAYED NERVES

That could mean bad news for 46 million Americans with no health insurance, who could flood public health offices where vaccinations will be free.

&quot;It could overload some systems in terms of staffing and frayed nerves,&quot; Hutchens said.

The Obama administration has sought to smooth the program&apos;s path by giving health departments and hospitals $1.4 billion to help plan and implement the vaccination effort, including the hiring of additional staff and contractors.

&quot;We can&apos;t do this ourselves,&quot; said Fran Phillips, deputy secretary of Maryland&apos;s public health services, whose staff has assembled 3,000 private vaccinators to supplement two-dozen local public health departments. Maryland has received $24 million in federal grants to help with the effort.

Preparations appear to be less uniform in states like Michigan, where much of the authority rests with local health departments. Michigan received $34 million in federal money.

&quot;They&apos;re really in the process right now of utilizing the funds, hiring folks or contracting with vaccinators,&quot; said Dr. Eden Wells of the Michigan Department of Community Health.

&quot;It&apos;s too early to make a judgment about whether the (federal) money is enough.&quot;

    <body>LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline said on Friday a second clinical trial of its adjuvanted H1N1 swine flu vaccine Pandemrix had confirmed that a single dose could provide a strong immune response.

Glaxo&apos;s vaccine -- containing an additive, or adjuvant, to boost its effectiveness -- was approved for use in Europe last month. It has not been cleared for use in the United States.

Experts had initially expected adults would need two doses of H1N1 vaccine to get a good response. But clinical trials with shots from companies including Glaxo, Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis and CSL now suggest one dose is probably enough.

The British-based drugmaker recently started sending supplies of Pandemrix to governments and said it had delivered more than 7 million doses in the first week of shipments, adding that deliveries would increase in the coming weeks.

Britain is one of the first countries to receive the vaccine. Officials said on Thursday that millions of doses of the Glaxo vaccine would be available for use throughout the state health service by the end of this month. [ID:nLF319273]

Local health departments eliminated 8,000 positions in the first half of this year, after 7,000 job cuts in 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Another 12,000 employees have been subjected to reduced hours or mandatory furloughs this year.

The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials says three-quarters of states have cut public health funding this year, while 61 percent expect smaller budgets in 2010. Seven states have cut back specifically on immunization.

Layoffs have targeted people needed for the H1N1 program -- nurses, nurse&apos;s aides and switchboard operators and receptionists who would help field public queries.

&quot;The problem is that there&apos;s a big rusty faucet at the end of the vaccine pipeline,&quot; said the University of Minnesota&apos;s Michael Osterholm, who warns public fears could flare quickly if H1N1 overwhelms hospitals and their intensive care units.

A poll by the American College of Emergency Physicians says almost 90 percent of emergency room doctors worry hospitals could have a hard time responding to a surge in H1N1 flu.

&quot;Public health is the life raft,&quot; Osterholm said. &quot;But are they big enough to get everybody on board and how will they navigate those rough waters?&quot;

Experts were careful not to criticize the caliber of public health staff, widely respected for their energy and devotion.

But they said meager resources, combined with the scale and speed of the national immunization program, will bring unprecedented strains.

FRAYED NERVES

That could mean bad news for 46 million Americans with no health insurance, who could flood public health offices where vaccinations will be free.

&quot;It could overload some systems in terms of staffing and frayed nerves,&quot; Hutchens said.

The Obama administration has sought to smooth the program&apos;s path by giving health departments and hospitals $1.4 billion to help plan and implement the vaccination effort, including the hiring of additional staff and contractors.

&quot;We can&apos;t do this ourselves,&quot; said Fran Phillips, deputy secretary of Maryland&apos;s public health services, whose staff has assembled 3,000 private vaccinators to supplement two-dozen local public health departments. Maryland has received $24 million in federal grants to help with the effort.

Preparations appear to be less uniform in states like Michigan, where much of the authority rests with local health departments. Michigan received $34 million in federal money.

&quot;They&apos;re really in the process right now of utilizing the funds, hiring folks or contracting with vaccinators,&quot; said Dr. Eden Wells of the Michigan Department of Community Health.

&quot;It&apos;s too early to make a judgment about whether the (federal) money is enough.&quot;

    <body>By David Morgan -- Analysis

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government&apos;s $6.4 billion swine flu vaccination program is likely to put the American public health sector under unprecedented strain and expose serious shortcomings, experts say.

As the first mass U.S. immunization program in a generation ramps up to deliver tens of millions of doses each week, public health experts disagree about how well the country&apos;s network of state and local health departments might perform.

But many say the sector never received the money it needed for large-scale immunizations despite years of planning for pandemics after the reemergence of bird flu in Hong Kong and South Korea in 2003.

&quot;The worst-case scenario is that there is vaccine in a particular state or locale but that state or locale hasn&apos;t sufficiently planned to distribute it,&quot; said Leonard Marcus of the Harvard School of Public Health.

Marcus, who studied the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster, said the H1N1 immunization program could encounter similar breakdowns in leadership and coordination wherever local public health systems are underfunded or poorly managed.

&quot;Some bureaucrat is going to say he doesn&apos;t have authority or needs a signature and it&apos;s going to stop the system from moving. That could very well cause panic,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.

Experts give the Obama administration high marks for creating a program capable of procuring 250 million doses and distributing them to 90,000 sites nationwide so that every American who wants the vaccine can get it.

The government has ordered vaccine from five companies -- Sanofi-Aventis SA, CSL Ltd, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline and the AstraZeneca unit MedImmune.

&quot;RUSTY FAUCET&quot;

Bob Hutchens, a vaccine distribution expert with consulting firm Booz &amp; Co, expects overall success.

    <body>(Repeats to fix typo in headline)

GENEVA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - H1N1 pandemic influenza remains a cause for concern because of its unpredictable nature, even though it has killed fewer than 5,000 people so far this year, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

A statement from the United Nations health agency said that more than 4,735 deaths attributable to H1N1, known as swine flu, had been reported, and that influenza activity in the northern hemisphere was much higher than usual.

But WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from the death toll as experts needed to monitor a full year of the disease, which the WHO declared a pandemic in June after the strain was first detected in April.

&quot;Although the death rate might not be enormous at the moment we do have to continue to be prepared for developments as we go through the winter in the northern hemisphere,&quot; Hartl said.

In particular, health experts need to observe the behaviour of the virus during the traditional January-February peak of the influenza season in the northern hemisphere, he told a briefing.

Most people who catch the H1N1 virus suffer mild symptoms.

But in contrast to seasonal flu strains which can be serious for elderly people, H1N1 can turn dangerous for some people with existing health conditions or otherwise healthy young adults.

&quot;There is a small subset of cases that do and can progress quite rapidly to severe disease and this is sometimes in the space of less than 24 hours and it then becomes a big, big challenge to save the people,&quot; Hartl said.

&quot;This disease continues to cause concern because it doesn&apos;t act exactly like seasonal influenza and because it doesn&apos;t affect the same groups who are affected by seasonal influenza.&quot; (For the WHO statement go to link.reuters.com/keq34f ) (Reporting by Jonathan Lynn; Editing by Jon Boyle)</body>

    <body>LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline said on Friday a second clinical trial of its adjuvanted H1N1 swine flu vaccine Pandemrix had confirmed that a single dose could provide a strong immune response.

Glaxo&apos;s vaccine -- containing an additive, or adjuvant, to boost its effectiveness -- was approved for use in Europe last month. It has not been cleared for use in the United States.

Experts had initially expected adults would need two doses of H1N1 vaccine to get a good response. But clinical trials with shots from companies including Glaxo, Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis and CSL now suggest one dose is probably enough.

The British-based drugmaker recently started sending supplies of Pandemrix to governments and said it had delivered more than 7 million doses in the first week of shipments, adding that deliveries would increase in the coming weeks.

Britain is one of the first countries to receive the vaccine. Officials said on Thursday that millions of doses of the Glaxo vaccine would be available for use throughout the state health service by the end of this month. [ID:nLF319273]

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - How many people have been infected with the new swine flu? How many will it kill? How do you catch it?

Health authorities around the world are trying to persuade people to line up to be vaccinated against the pandemic H1N1 virus even as they struggle to answer these basic questions.

H1N1 swine flu was declared a pandemic in June and the World Health Organization says more than 375,000 people globally have been infected and 4,500 have died.

But these are just laboratory-confirmed cases and the WHO says they are the tip of the iceberg. Only a small fraction of people who get swine flu ever have it confirmed by a doctor.

Here is a rundown of what experts do and do not know about pandemic H1N1 influenza.

WHAT THEY KNOW

* The virus spread around the world in the space of six weeks and is now virtually everywhere.

* It strongly resembles seasonal influenza in that it causes fever, sore throat, a dry cough, muscle aches and tiredness.

* Unlike seasonal influenza, worst among the elderly, this new influenza batters younger people.

* Many people escape without symptoms. Dr. Tim Uyeki, a flu expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says studies show 12 percent of people do not have fever. &quot;A lot of people might think they don&apos;t have influenza because they don&apos;t have classic influenza-like illness,&quot; Uyeki told a meeting of the Pan American Health Organization on Wednesday.

* H1N1 may cause symptoms not normally seen in seasonal flu. &quot;We are seeing diarrhea and vomiting in children of all ages as well as adults,&quot; Uyeki said. It can also infect the heart, a condition called myocarditis, affect the brain in what is called encephalopathy and cause multiple organ failure.

* The incubation period -- the time from infection to when symptoms begin -- ranges from one to four days.

* People can spread virus for 24 hours after the fever stops.

* Adults over the age of 60 are less likely to be infected and to become seriously ill with H1N1, in part because they seem to have some immunity to it. The highest rates of hospitalization are among the youngest children -- aged up to 4 -- but the highest rates of death are in adults aged 50 to 64.

* The new vaccine should protect against H1N1 well and antiviral drugs can treat it if given soon enough.

WHAT THEY DON&apos;T KNOW

* How many people have been infected. The World Health Organization and CDC stopped counting months ago. There are not enough diagnostic tests in the world to test everyone who gets sick, and not enough doctors, nurses or technicians to administer them. The tests that exist are not very good at detecting H1N1. All WHO or CDC will say is that &quot;millions&quot; have been infected.

* The fatality rate for H1N1. Uyeki says death rate estimates are all under 1 percent with a median range of 0.4 percent. Without knowing how many people in total have been infected, researchers cannot say what proportion have died. Seasonal influenza kills less than 0.1 percent of patients but this adds up to 250,000 to 500,000 people globally each year.

* How people catch it. &quot;We don&apos;t actually have good data on understanding how this virus is transmitted,&quot; Uyeki said. The virus lives in little droplets of mucus and tests show it can be picked up on surfaces such as computer keyboards, passed in a sneeze or during close conversation, and perhaps transmitted in smaller particles that can float up to six feet.

Uyeki said it is possible H1N1 may be passed in feces, as the virus affects the gastrointestinal tract, but no one knows.

* How long patients are contagious. &quot;I think we don&apos;t really understand this well,&quot; said Uyeki. People with higher fevers and children appear to &quot;shed&quot; more virus.

* What makes a flu virus deadly. Genetic analysis has shown nothing special about the viruses infecting people who died, said Dr. Michael Shaw, assistant director of laboratory science at CDC&apos;s influenza division. &quot;There is nothing that really stands out about these viruses that have been isolated from the severe or fatal cases,&quot; Shaw told the PAHO meeting.

* What other viruses are out there. Shaw said farmers rarely test swine herds, a known source of new flu viruses.

&quot;When you go and pull the data that&apos;s available from GenBank you can find maybe 300 sequences from North American swine viruses,&quot; Shaw said. &quot;There is essentially nothing from Africa or Central or South America. There obviously are some gaps that need to be plugged so that something (else) like this doesn&apos;t surprise us.&quot;

* 86 U.S. children killed by H1N1 so far

* Virus widespread in 41 U.S. states (Updates with quotes, details)

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Delivery of some swine flu vaccines has been delayed because companies cannot make it as fast as they had hoped, just as the virus has really started to spread, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said that while 40 million doses had been anticipated for the end of October, only about 28 to 30 million doses would be available.

&quot;Yields for vaccine are lower than would be hoped,&quot; Schuchat said in a telephone briefing. &quot;We unfortunately won&apos;t have as much at the end of this month as we had hoped to.&quot;

She also said deaths from H1N1 swine flu were above the epidemic threshold in some U.S. cities and states. H1N1 flu activity was widespread in 41 states, she said.

&quot;It is unprecedented for this time of year to have the whole country having such high levels of activity,&quot; Schuchat said.

&quot;There are now a total of 86 children under 18 who have died from the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,&quot; she added. Many had died in recent weeks and the number was now higher than the usual number of child deaths in an entire flu season.

&quot;These are very sobering statistics ... 43 deaths in one month is a lot,&quot; Schuchat said. &quot;Some of these children have been totally healthy.&quot;

Older children were hardest hit, she said, with 16 deaths among 5- to 11-year-olds and 19 deaths in 12- to 17-year-olds.

The new virus, which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June, does not seem any deadlier than seasonal influenza. But it attacks a different age group -- older children and young adults, unlike seasonal flu, which affects mostly elderly people and kills up to 36,000 in a normal year.

And because hardly anyone has immunity, the H1N1 virus may infect far more people than seasonal flu does in a single season.

BUMPY DELIVERY

Schuchat said 15 percent to 20 percent of patients with H1N1 who needed to be hospitalized were requiring intensive care. &quot;Influenza is widespread in the country and illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase,&quot; she said.

The U.S. government has opted to roll out seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1 vaccines as they become available, which the CDC has said could make for a bumpy vaccination plan.

People need both vaccines to be protected from all the circulating viruses, although Schuchat says virtually all cases of influenza are due to the new H1N1 virus.

As of Wednesday, 11.4 million doses of H1N1 vaccine were available and 8 million had been ordered by states for distribution.

The U.S. government has ordered both types of flu vaccine from five companies: Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) unit MedImmune.

Schuchat said 82 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine had been distributed, with a total of 114 million doses ordered. On Thursday CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) said it would cut short its flu-shot clinics due to delivery delays.

&quot;This is how influenza vaccine production often goes,&quot; Schuchat said. She said there should be widespread availability by November and advised people who wanted a vaccine but were having trouble finding one to keep trying. (Editing by David Morgan and Anthony Boadle)</body>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delivery of some swine flu vaccines has been delayed because companies cannot make it as fast as they had hoped, just as the virus has really started to spread, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said that while 40 million doses had been anticipated for the end of October, only about 28 to 30 million doses would be available.

&quot;Yields for vaccine are lower than would be hoped,&quot; Schuchat said in a telephone briefing. &quot;We unfortunately won&apos;t have as much at the end of this month as we had hoped to.&quot;

She also said deaths from H1N1 swine flu were above the epidemic threshold in some U.S. cities and states. H1N1 flu activity was widespread in 41 states, she said.

&quot;It is unprecedented for this time of year to have the whole country having such high levels of activity,&quot; Schuchat said.

&quot;There are now a total of 86 children under 18 who have died from the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,&quot; she added. Many had died in recent weeks and the number was now higher than the usual number of child deaths in an entire flu season.

&quot;These are very sobering statistics ... 43 deaths in one month is a lot,&quot; Schuchat said. &quot;Some of these children have been totally healthy.&quot;

Older children were hardest hit, she said, with 16 deaths among 5- to 11-year-olds and 19 deaths in 12- to 17-year-olds.

The new virus, which emerged in March and was declared a pandemic in June, does not seem any deadlier than seasonal influenza. But it attacks a different age group -- older children and young adults, unlike seasonal flu, which affects mostly elderly people and kills up to 36,000 in a normal year.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new H1N1 flu is &quot;strikingly different&quot; from seasonal influenza, killing much younger people than ordinary flu and often killing them very fast, World Health Organization officials said on Friday.

A review of studies done during the seven months the virus has been circulating shows it is usually mild, but can cause unusual and severe symptoms in an unlucky few, according to a WHO-sponsored meeting in Washington this week.

&quot;Participants who have managed such cases agreed that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza,&quot; WHO&apos;s Dr. Nikki Shindo told the meeting.

Swine flu was declared a pandemic in June and has been circulating globally. WHO stopped trying to count cases, as there are nowhere near enough tests to formally diagnose everyone who gets sick.

Separately on Friday, Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 86 U.S. children had died of swine flu, most in the 5- to 17-year old age group that normally escapes serious bouts with flu.

&quot;In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit,&quot; Shindo said.

While most such patients need to be put on ventilators right away, some are not helped by this treatment, Shindo noted.

In some places, she said, emergency rooms have been overwhelmed with patients, many requiring critical care.

The good news is that quick treatment with the antiviral drugs oseltamivir, made by Roche AG under the brand name Tamiflu, and zanamivir, made by GlaxoSmithKline as Relenza, helps a great deal, she said.

Usually influenza is a disease of the upper respiratory tract, affecting the nose and throat. But H1N1 goes deeper, into the lungs.

&quot;This virus really likes the lower respiratory tract. That means this virus is very likely to cause viral pneumonia compared to seasonal influenza,&quot; Shindo told a news conference.

Among the doctors speaking to the WHO meeting was Dr. Anand Kumar of St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba, who reported swine flu&apos;s effects in the Journal of the American Medical Association this week.

&quot;At one point, 50 percent of the available ICU (intensive care unit) beds in the entire city were filled with H1N1 patients,&quot; Kumar said in a telephone interview. &quot;We basically maxed out our capacity.

Shindo said WHO was struggling to understand what the risk factors are for a serious bout with swine flu.

&quot;Although the exact role of obesity is poorly understood at present, obesity and especially morbid obesity have been present in a large portion of severe and fatal cases,&quot; Shindo said. &quot;Obesity has not been recognized as a risk factor in either past pandemics or seasonal influenza.&quot;

    <body>* Japan approves Cervarix, Symbicort and Januvia

* Approvals will boost sales for Glaxo, Astra and Merck

* Western firms see new opportunities in Japanese market

* Cancer drugs and vaccines among areas targeted

(Adds detail on Januvia approval)

By Ben Hirschler

LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N) all won approval to sell new products in Japan on Friday, highlighting the untapped potential of the Japanese market for Western drugmakers.

In the past, the country has been a tough one for foreign firms to crack. But recent steps to speed up the approval process are now opening the door to a raft of commercially important medicines.

Glaxo&apos;s cervical cancer vaccine Cervarix won a green light in Japan ahead of Merck &amp; Co&apos;s (MRK.N) rival Gardasil, boosting a product with a patchy record.

Cervarix has been on sale in Europe since 2007, but it has only just been approved in the United States -- approval there also came on Friday -- and consensus global sales forecasts are $1.01 billion for 2013, according to Thomson Pharma. That equates to around 2 percent of expected 2013 Glaxo revenue.

AstraZeneca&apos;s asthma drug Symbicort, meanwhile, is already established in Europe and the United States, where it is a key driver, with sales last year of $2 billion.

Following the Japanese green light, Symbicort will now be sold in Japan via a partnership with Astellas Pharma (4503.T).

The third international medicine to win approval was Merck&apos;s blockbuster diabetes drug Januvia, which was co-developed in the country by the U.S. group&apos;s Japanese subsidiary Banyu and Ono Pharmaceutical (4528.OS).

Januvia, which belongs to a new class of treatments called DPP-4 inibitors, sold $1.4 billion worldwide in 2008.

PLENTY TO PLAY FOR

With sales last year of $76.6 billion, the Japanese drug market is the second largest in the world after the United States and accounts for 10 percent of global sales, according to IMS Health.

Japanese growth rates are relatively slow -- IMS predicts annual growth of 1 to 4 percent over the next 5 years -- due in part to strict government price controls.

But international companies with new products lined up for launch expect to outstrip that pedestrian rate as they grab a bigger slice of the action.

With its greying population Japan offers particularly rich pickings for medicines treating conditions linked to old age, such as cancer.

That makes it attractive to Roche (ROG.VX), the world&apos;s top maker of cancer drugs, vindicating its decision to buy majority control of Chugai Pharmaceutical (4519.T) seven years ago.

Vaccines are another lucrative market, as shown by Cervarix, and the recent award of H1N1 swine flu vaccine contracts to Glaxo and Novartis (NOVN.VX). [ID:nT239775]

Adding to the appeal of the market is the fact that Japanese doctors currently prescribe relatively few generic drugs. That is a big help to makers of branded medicines, although the government aims to increase the volume of cheaper generics used in future.

&quot;With Japan a strategic focus for a number of European pharma companies, visibility of sales in this market is likely to increase,&quot; analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note this week.

&quot;European companies lag their domestic counterparts in terms of exposure in Japan, so have plenty to play for.&quot;

Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) has also long made Japan a key focus and, thanks to longer patents, it should continue to enjoy strong sales of drugs like Plavix and Lovenox in the country after they may face generic competition in other markets. (Editing by David Cowell)</body>

    <body>* Argentina&apos;s economy unexpectedly grows in August

* First monthly year-on-year expansion since April (Recasts, adds details)

BUENOS AIRES, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Argentina&apos;s economy unexpectedly grew in August from the same month a year earlier, as activity tentatively picked up in the key automotive and steel industries, the government said on Friday.

Latin America&apos;s No. 3 economy expanded 0.1 percent in August, its first monthly growth since April and far exceeding the median forecast for a 1.4 percent contraction in a Reuters poll of seven analysts.

The monthly EMAE economic activity index, which measures most elements of gross domestic product, also showed the economy grew 1.1 percent in August from July. The economy expanded by 5.5 percent in August 2008.

Analysts say Argentina&apos;s economy is still feeling the impact of the outbreak of the H1N1 virus during the winter season but that the auto sector, steelmaking and construction were beginning to show signs of improvement.

Argentina&apos;s official growth data has been better than analysts&apos; expectations in recent months, raising suspicions that the numbers are overly optimistic and have been hiding a sharper slowdown.

But despite the rebound, the latest reading is still a far cry from the rapid economic expansion Argentina enjoyed until recently, with annual growth running at rates above 6.0 percent for the last six years.

Last month, Argentina slashed its official economic growth forecast for 2009. The economy is now expected to expand just 0.5 percent this year from a previous forecast of 4.0 percent made a year ago. The government expects the economy to grow 2.5 percent in 2010. (Reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues; Editing by Diane Craft)</body>

By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Cosmetics maker Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) expects to post a much higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raise its fiscal-year forecast later this month, after sales topped expectations, sending its shares up more than 5 percent.

The company, best known for its eponymous line and brands such as Clinique, said it still had a cautious view on consumer spending.

Estee Lauder derives much of its sales from department store makeup counters, which have been pressured by a drop in spending as consumers cut back on nonessential purchases.

In August, the company forecast a weaker-than-expected 2010 profit as it dealt with slack demand for makeup, perfume and skincare items during the lengthy recession. [ID:nN13265204]

Estee Lauder cited tight cost controls, new products, growth in Asia, increased traffic in its travel retail business and improved currency translation for its upbeat forecast on Friday. It said sales in the first quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, also got a boost from from earlier holiday shipments, which it had expected to land in the second quarter.

The company said first-quarter earnings before restructuring charges should be &quot;significantly higher than previous guidance.&quot;

In August, Estee Lauder forecast first-quarter earnings of 23 cents to 30 cents per share. Analysts on average expect a profit of 25 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2010 FORECAST TO BE RAISED

While Estee Lauder said it remained cautious about the economy and consumer spending throughout the year, it plans to increase its fiscal-year profit forecast when it reports first-quarter results on Oct. 30.

In August, the company forecast fiscal-year earnings of $1.55 to $1.70 per share. Analysts are calling for a profit of $1.69.

Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said he expected the 2010 forecast to be raised &quot;materially,&quot; perhaps closer to $1.70 to $1.85 per share.

The increase in the fiscal 2010 outlook may only stem from the first-quarter upside, BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty said in a note to clients.

Estee Lauder said it spent less than planned in the first quarter due to the global economic downturn and the potential impact of the H1N1 flu. It expects to speed up investment spending above first-quarter levels during the remainder of fiscal 2010.

&quot;Investment spending may limit the potential earnings&quot; in the rest of the year, said Maneaty, who has a &quot;market perform&quot; rating on Estee Lauder.

&quot;We like the change underway at Estee Lauder,&quot; she wrote, &quot;but we believe it is fully reflected in the stock price and valuation.

Shares of Estee Lauder rose 5.5 percent to $41.26 in premarket trading. (Reporting by Jessica Wohl; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)</body>

    <body>By Tony Bradley - PC World

Last-minute shoppers and instant gratification junkies rejoice! Amazon.com announced that it is going to start offering same-day shipping just in time for the upcoming holiday shopping season.

The service, dubbed Local Express Delivery, will only be offered in select markets though--so if you live in San Francisco you can put away the confetti. You&apos;ll still be using the traditional shipping methods. Sorry.

Basically, in order to be able to meet a same-day delivery commitment Amazon can only really offer the service in large markets within a reasonable distance of a distribution hub. Amazon.com is implementing same-day service in New York, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Baltimore, Boston, Washington DC, and Seattle. There are plans to add Chicago, Indianapolis, and Phoenix in the near future.

The cut-off time to be able to receive same-day delivery varies from city to city. For most markets the cut-off will be around 10 or 11 AM. Shoppers in Seattle can place orders as late as 1 PM and still get their delivery that same day.

Amazon already has a premium shipping option called Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime members pay $79 per year to subscribe to the service. Members receive unlimited free 2-day shipping on a variety of items, and can upgrade to one-day shipping for an additional cost of $3.99.

Amazon Prime customers in Local Express Delivery markets can upgrade to the same-day delivery service for $5.99. Rates for non-Amazon Prime members are not yet available. Suffice it to say that it is safe to assume that premium shipping will come at a premium cost.

Barnes &amp; Noble already offers a same-day delivery service which is free for orders over $25. However, the Barnes &amp; Noble service is only available in Manhattan. Barnes &amp; Noble, which has both an online and a brick &amp; mortar presence, is one of Amazon&apos;s biggest competitors. In addition to competing as retailers, Barnes &amp; Noble is apparently going to unveil its own eReader to compete against Amazon&apos;s. Kindle device.

Similar services sprang up a decade ago during the height of the dot.com boom. Kozmo and Urban Fetch offered same-day delivery services. Like Barnes &amp; Noble though, services were limited to the Manhattan market.

I have been an Amazon Prime member for years and I always get my $79 worth out of the deal. There are plenty of times when I have done last minute shopping or been so anxious for a new gadget that I would be willing to pay a little extra. Sadly, Houston is not an Amazon Local Express Delivery market, so I won&apos;t get to test it out.

With the world just beginning to claw its way out recession most consumers are still lacking in discretionary cash. As it is, holiday shopping may be lighter than usual and cost-conscious shoppers may be more interested in shopping locally than paying for shipping at all.

However, with threats like the H1N1 flu virus, intrepid shoppers have good reason to make their purchases from the comfort of their office or living room and avoid areas with lots of people and the germs they bring with them.

    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new pandemic H1N1 flu may cause blood clots and other unusual damage in the lungs and doctors need to be on the lookout, U.S. researchers reported on Thursday.

Two studies published in the American Journal of Roentgenology show the need to check X-rays and CT scans for unusual features, and also point out swine flu can be tricky to diagnose in some of the sickest patients.

H1N1 flu is causing a pandemic, and while it is not particularly deadly, it is sickening many younger adults and older children who usually escape the worst effects of seasonal flu.

&quot;It is therefore essential that clinicians be able to recognize possible cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza in high-risk groups so that they order the appropriate diagnostic tests, begin specific antiviral therapy, and prepare to provide intensive supportive measures as needed,&quot; Dr. Daniel Mollura of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Maryland and colleagues wrote.

One middle-aged man who died was not diagnosed until after death, but unusual findings on his X-rays may be able to help doctors save other, similar patients.

Mollura&apos;s team found irregularities called ground-glass opacities in the patient&apos;s lungs using a CT scan. Although the patient was severely ill and had a fever, he tested negative for flu and doctors did not treat him for it.

The man died five days after he went into the hospital and the autopsy confirmed he had swine flu. The lung lesions seen on his CT scan matched lung damage done by the virus, Mollura and colleagues said.

In another study in the same journal, CT scans of patients with severe cases of swine flu showed many had pulmonary emboli, which block the arteries in the lungs, a team at the University of Michigan found.

Anticoagulant drugs can break up these clots and save lives.

Dr. Prachi Agarwal and colleagues examined 66 patients diagnosed with H1N1, 14 of them who were in the intensive care unit. All 66 got standard X-rays, which can show if a patient has pneumonia.

They performed enhanced X-rays known as computed tomography or CT scans on 15 of the patients, 10 of them who were in the ICU on ventilators to help them breathe. Five of the ICU patients had the blood clots in the lungs, Agarwal reported

&quot;Our study suggests that patients who are severely ill with H1N1 are also at risk for developing pulmonary emboli, which should be carefully sought for on contrast-enhanced CT scans,&quot; Agarwal said in a statement.

&quot;The majority of patients undergoing chest X-rays with H1N1 have normal radiographs (X-rays),&quot; she added. Pulmonary emboli are also not normally seen in flu, she said.

&quot;CT scans proved valuable in identifying those patients at risk of developing more serious complications as a possible result of the H1N1 virus, and for identifying a greater extent of disease than is appreciated on chest radiographs.&quot;

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New guidelines on protecting hospital workers against the H1N1 swine flu stress keeping influenza patients away from others and put protective equipment such as face masks last.

The new guidelines posted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urge hospitals to vaccinate as many staff as possible against H1N1 and to bar entry to visitors with flu-like symptoms.

The best way to protect staff and patients from the virus is to keep it out of the facility, the CDC advises.

&quot;Examples ... include: taking steps to minimize outpatient visits for patients with mild influenza-like illness who do not have risk factors for complications, postponing elective visits by patients with suspected or confirmed influenza until they are no longer infectious, and denying entry to visitors who are sick,&quot; the CDC said.

Partitions in waiting rooms can help reduce spread, as can special equipment for airway suction in patients with breathing tubes.

Administrative controls such as required vaccination of staff, keeping sick staff at home, hand hygiene strategies and setting up separate waiting area for patients with flu-like illness can also help, the CDC said.

It said personal protective equipment or PPE ranked last in controlling flu, in part because it only works well when used consistently and properly.

&quot;Careful attention to elimination of potential exposures, engineering controls, and administrative controls will reduce the need to rely on PPE, including respirators,&quot; the CDC said.

&quot;This is an especially important consideration during the current year, when shortages of respirators have already been reported by many healthcare facilities.&quot;

VACCINATING HEALTHCARE WORKERS

Face masks called the N95 respirators are considered the best protection against viruses but they are in short supply, must be fitted properly and are uncomfortable to wear.

The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America praised the decision.

&quot;We could actually put healthcare workers at greater risk by further reducing an already short supply of a device that is needed for high-risk procedures such as bronchoscopy by using it for routine care,&quot; said Dr. Mark Rupp of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, who is president of SHEA.

&quot;The best science available leaves no doubt that the best way to protect people is by vaccinating them.&quot;

The CDC has advice on encouraging healthcare workers to get vaccinated against H1N1. Usually only about 40 percent of nurses, doctors and technicians are immunized against seasonal influenza.

&quot;To improve adherence, vaccination should be offered to healthcare personnel free of charge and during working hours. Vaccination campaigns with incentives such as lotteries with prizes should be considered. Healthcare facilities should require personnel who refuse vaccination to complete a declination form,&quot; the CDC advised.

Liberal sick leave policies will encourage sick workers to stay at home with their germs and signs can remind workers and visitors alike how to avoid spreading germs, it added.</body>

ZURICH, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Roche (ROG.VX) beat forecasts with a 10 percent rise in third-quarter sales, helped by demand for Tamiflu due to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, and the Swiss group now sees higher drug revenues for the full year.

Tamiflu outstripped expectations in the third quarter and Roche, the world&apos;s largest maker of cancer drugs which has sealed a $47 billion buyout of U.S. partner Genentech, on Thursday raised its 2009 forecast for both overall drug sales and the flu medicine.

&quot;Overall, a very good set of sales numbers,&quot; said Jefferies International analyst Jeffrey Holford. &quot;We continue to rate Roche as our favourite large-cap name in the European Pharma sector.&quot;

Hefty drug price increases and windfall sales from H1N1 swine flu have helped Big Pharma to a more successful year than feared, though the sector still has long-term problems such as greater competition for its big-selling drugs and trades at a discount to the wider market. [ID:nL7604472]

Two diversified healthcare groups have already demonstrated the sector&apos;s mixed prospects this week -- Abbott Laboratories&apos; (ABT.N) profit beat forecasts thanks to its Humira arthritis drug, while sales at rival Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) disappointed. [ID:nN13187111]

Investors are now looking to a string of more specialised pharmaceuticals makers reporting next week -- including Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) -- for more details on the sector&apos;s prospects.

Roche&apos;s third-quarter sales rose to 12.4 billion Swiss francs ($12.2 billion), versus expectations of 12.2 billion. The group nudged up its full-year drug sales forecast, now seeing &quot;at least&quot; high single-digit sales growth compared with a previous target of high single digits, and confirmed its earnings target. [ID:nL9135217]

The Swiss group has been trading at a premium to European rivals GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Novartis and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) thanks to its strong position in cancer and biotech drugs and lack of exposure to generic competition.

WINDFALL

Much of Roche&apos;s impressive performance was due to windfall sales of Tamiflu, however, and some analysts were underwhelmed by its world-leading cancer portfolio and said much of the good news was already priced in.

The stock -- which has gained nearly a fifth since July -- dropped 1.2 percent to 167.50 francs by 0740 GMT, versus a slightly stronger DJ Stoxx European healthcare sector .SXDP.

&quot;Raising the sales guidance is definitely a positive but this is mainly due to the strong Tamiflu performance,&quot; said Kepler Capital Markets analyst Daniel Daetwyler.

&quot;One needs to flag the relatively weak local product sales growth in the U.S. with the key oncology drugs.&quot;

Sales of Tamiflu, which Roche manufactures under licence from Gilead Sciences (GILD.O), more than quadrupled to 2 billion francs in the first nine months. Blockbuster cancer drug Avastin also underpinned growth, with nine-month sales up 26 percent.

Roche sees Tamiflu revenue of 2.7 billion francs, versus previous guidance of 2 billion.

The group repaid 7 billion francs of debt from its Genentech buyout in the third quarter and is committed to more than another 5 billion by mid-2010, and is still screening the market for small and mid-sized buys, Chief Executive Severin Schwan said.

CHICAGO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Baxter International Inc (BAX.N) reported slightly higher than expected quarterly earnings as expenses fell and margins expanded, but sales missed Wall Street&apos;s expectations, driving the hospital products maker&apos;s shares lower on Thursday.

The company, which also makes blood therapy and renal therapy products, pointed the Street towards the high end of its prior forecast range, calling for full-year earnings per share of $3.79 to $3.81 instead of $3.76 to $3.80.

For the current fourth quarter, it now expects earnings per share of $1.02 to $1.04, with sales up 8 percent to 10 percent.

Baxter said third-quarter earnings rose 12 percent to $530 million, or 87 cents per share, from $472 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time charges, profit was 98 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 97 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Earnings per share benefited from the company&apos;s continued share repurchase program.

Sales were $3.14 billion, unchanged from a year earlier and below Wall Street estimates of $3.19 billion. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, sales would have been up 7 percent.

Sales in the bioscience unit, which includes vaccines and blood therapy products, rose 2 percent but were slightly lower than many had expected, due partly to weaker than expected plasma protein sales.

Baxter Chief Financial Officer Rob Davis told a conference call that the company shifted $35 million in orders of plasma proteins and antibody therapy, primarily in Eastern Europe and Latin America, to the fourth quarter from the third quarter.

&quot;We continue to see strong demand and favorable year-on-year price improvements across the entire plasma protein portfolio,&quot; he said.

Davis said his outlook for plasma sales has not changed.

&quot;We&apos;re still confident we&apos;re going to see (percentage increases in the) high teens for the full year on a constant currency basis,&quot; Davis told analysts.

He also said he company will recognize $30 million to $40 million in revenue in the fourth quarter from its H1N1 vaccine, which the company began shipping in August.

Chief Executive Robert Parkinson characterized the business as a &quot;multiyear opportunity.&quot;

Among other business segments, renal sales fell 3 percent, while medication delivery sales rose 1 percent.

Parkinson told the conference call that he sees &quot;general improvement&quot; in capital spending among U.S. hospitals.

&quot;Over the next 6 to 12 months, we think investor focus will shift from stability to pipeline-driven growth,&quot; said Goldman analyst David Roman, who reaffirmed his &quot;neutral&quot; rating.

&quot;Until greater clarity emerges on the viability of the pipeline, we do not see much upside to the stock,&quot; he wrote in a research note.

Shares of Baxter were down $2.05 or 3.6 percent at $54.95 in morning trading. (Reporting by Debra Sherman; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Lisa Von Ahn)</body>

    <body>* Flu-shot clinics to offer vaccines through Oct. 22

By Ben Klayman

CHICAGO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) will cut short its flu-shot clinics due to manufacturer delays in delivering influenza vaccine, potentially weighing on hopes that customer flu-shot visits would help sales of other products.

The drugstore chain said its seasonal flu-shot clinics will run through Oct. 22 instead of the end of November. The company had planned about 9,000 scheduled clinics.

CVS&apos;s MinuteClinics will continue to offer seasonal vaccines at 500 locations in 25 states throughout the flu season, with the supply of vaccines replenished as frequently as possible.

&quot;Supply issues due to manufacturer delays and heavy consumer demand continue to cause shortages of seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; CVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis said in an email.

&quot;When we launched our campaign in September, we did not intend to end our flu clinic program in mid-October,&quot; he said.

Analysts had predicted CVS could see an earnings gain of up to 14 cents a share due to consumer fears about a swine flu pandemic and a heightened cold season.

DeAngelis said any financial information will be discussed when third-quarter results are released on Nov. 5.

Drugstores have been promoting themselves as destinations for flu shots. The campaigns revolve around the seasonal flu, although drugstores also hope to administer vaccinations for H1N1 flu, or swine flu, once they become more widely available.

WALGREEN SAYS NO SUPPLY TROUBLE

Drugstore rival Walgreen Co (WAG.N) said its supply was fine. Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) said some of its order was delayed but it still hopes to get its full allotment.

However, on Monday Rite Aid said seasonal flu-shot clinics in some of its West Coast stores had been canceled by outside provider Mollen Immunization Clinics through mid-December because of shortages. Rite Aid was still providing the vaccine through many of its pharmacies in that region.

A spokeswoman at Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), one of the world&apos;s largest flu vaccine makers, said the company will be able to deliver all the doses it promised, but there is some delay due to H1N1 production and because one of the strains in the seasonal vaccine takes longer to grow. Sanofi said it is producing 50.5 million seasonal doses.

Drugstore chains began offering in-store flu shots in earnest in early September, well ahead of the official start of influenza season on Oct. 4, as determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

CVS, with more than 7,000 CVS and Longs Drugs stores, said consumers are getting flu shots at its pharmacies and MinuteClinics at rates far above last year and even above CVS expectations.

The company plans to continue receiving the seasonal vaccines from its suppliers, but due to the continued delays and isolated shortages it will focus on providing the shots through its MinuteClinics, DeAngelis said.

Walgreens plans to provide 5 million seasonal flu shots and has already offered about 4.5 million, spokesman Michael Polzin said. &quot;We got our full supply and we&apos;ve given out most of its already.&quot;

Rite Aid spokeswoman Cheryl Slavinsky said the delays were caused by manufacturers switching production to the H1N1 vaccine, and those delays would be addressed when suppliers switched back to production of the seasonal vaccine.

&quot;We have spot shortages here and there,&quot; she said. &quot;We still have not gotten all of our shipment ordered from the manufacturer in the spring.

&quot;Our manufacturer has not given us any indication that our full order won&apos;t be fulfilled,&quot; she added. &quot;It&apos;s just delayed.&quot;

CVS shares rose 1.2 percent to $37.84 on Thursday afternoon. Walgreen gained 2.2 percent and Rite Aid slipped 0.6 percent. (Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Tim Dobbyn and Gerald E. McCormick)</body>

    <body>NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Overseas shares traded in the United States were little changed on Thursday as rising European stocks offset a decline in Asian shares.

Shares edged up in Europe despite a surprise quarterly loss from Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia.

New York-traded shares of Nokia (NOK.N) fell more than 10 percent to $13.74 after the world&apos;s top cellphone maker took a major writedown at its struggling networks unit and posted a fall in smartphone sales. For details see [ID:nLF596616].

The BoNY index of leading Asian ADRs .BKAS fell 0.5 percent, hurt by Chinese and Japanese shares despite overnight gains in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo.

ADRs of China Mobile Ltd (CHL.N), the world&apos;s largest mobile communications provider, slid 1.2 percent to $50.63.

ADRs of Chinese mobile entertainment provider Linktone (LTON.O) soared 37 percent to $2.83 and topped the percentage gainers list after the company announced an agreement to make video highlights of Major League Baseball games available to customers in China.

The BoNY index of leading European ADRs .BKEUR rose 0.2 percent. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top shares rose 0.1 percent as British retailers jumped on takeover fever in the sector.

ADRs of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.N) rose 2.3 percent to $41.24. Britain&apos;s chief medical officer said a nationwide vaccination program will start next week, with 415,000 doses of GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s Pandemrix delivered to immunize high-risk hospital patients and front-line healthcare workers against the H1N1 flu virus. [ID:nLF319273].

The BoNY index of leading Latin American ADRs .BKLA dipped 0.1 percent. In Latin America, major benchmarks were little changed in afternoon trading.

ADRs of Brazilian miner Vale (VALE.N), one of the volume leaders in the session, edged up 0.5 percent to $26.82.</body>

By Sam Cage

ZURICH, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Roche (ROG.VX) beat forecasts with a 10 percent rise in third-quarter sales, helped by demand for Tamiflu due to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, and the Swiss group now sees higher drug revenues for the full year.

Tamiflu outstripped expectations in the third quarter and Roche, the world&apos;s largest maker of cancer drugs which has sealed a $47 billion buyout of U.S. partner Genentech, on Thursday raised its 2009 forecast for both overall drug sales and the flu medicine.

&quot;Overall, a very good set of sales numbers,&quot; said Jefferies International analyst Jeffrey Holford. &quot;We continue to rate Roche as our favourite large-cap name in the European Pharma sector.&quot;

Hefty drug price increases and windfall sales from H1N1 swine flu have helped Big Pharma to a more successful year than feared, though the sector still has long-term problems such as greater competition for its big-selling drugs and trades at a discount to the wider market. [ID:nL7604472]

Two diversified healthcare groups have already demonstrated the sector&apos;s mixed prospects this week -- Abbott Laboratories&apos; (ABT.N) profit beat forecasts thanks to its Humira arthritis drug, while sales at rival Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) disappointed. [ID:nN13187111]

Investors are now looking to a string of more specialised pharmaceuticals makers reporting next week -- including Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) -- for more details on the sector&apos;s prospects.

Roche&apos;s third-quarter sales rose to 12.4 billion Swiss francs ($12.2 billion), versus expectations of 12.2 billion. The group nudged up its full-year drug sales forecast, now seeing &quot;at least&quot; high single-digit sales growth compared with a previous target of high single digits, and confirmed its earnings target. [ID:nL9135217]

The Swiss group has been trading at a premium to European rivals GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Novartis and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) thanks to its strong position in cancer and biotech drugs and lack of exposure to generic competition.

WINDFALL

Much of Roche&apos;s impressive performance was due to windfall sales of Tamiflu, however, and some analysts were underwhelmed by its world-leading cancer portfolio and said much of the good news was already priced in.

The stock -- which has gained nearly a fifth since July -- dropped 1.2 percent to 167.50 francs by 0740 GMT, versus a slightly stronger DJ Stoxx European healthcare sector .SXDP.

&quot;Raising the sales guidance is definitely a positive but this is mainly due to the strong Tamiflu performance,&quot; said Kepler Capital Markets analyst Daniel Daetwyler.

&quot;One needs to flag the relatively weak local product sales growth in the U.S. with the key oncology drugs.&quot;

Sales of Tamiflu, which Roche manufactures under licence from Gilead Sciences (GILD.O), more than quadrupled to 2 billion francs in the first nine months. Blockbuster cancer drug Avastin also underpinned growth, with nine-month sales up 26 percent.

Roche sees Tamiflu revenue of 2.7 billion francs, versus previous guidance of 2 billion.

The group repaid 7 billion francs of debt from its Genentech buyout in the third quarter and is committed to more than another 5 billion by mid-2010, and is still screening the market for small and mid-sized buys, Chief Executive Severin Schwan said.

    <body>By Kate Kelland

LONDON (Reuters Life!) - People are more likely to wash their hands properly after using the toilet if they are shamed into it or think they are being watched, scientists said on Thursday.

Handwashing is the cheapest way of controlling disease but less than one third of men and two thirds of women wash their hands with soap after going to the toilet, a British study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine showed.

But when prompted by an electronic message flashing up on a board asking: &quot;Is the person next to you washing with soap?,&quot; around 12 percent more men and 11 percent more women used soap.

Health authorities around the world are stepping up efforts to persuade people to be more hygienic and wash their hands properly to help slow the spread of H1N1 swine flu, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in June.

&quot;Handwashing with soap has been ranked the most cost-effective intervention for the worldwide control of disease,&quot; the study&apos;s authors wrote.

&quot;It could save more than a million lives a year from diarrhoeal diseases, and prevent respiratory infections -- the biggest causes of child mortality in developing countries.&quot;

In developed nations, handwashing can help prevent the spread of viral infections like flu and sickness and diarrhea bugs like norovirus and rotavirus, as well as hospital-acquired infections like MRSA and C-difficile, the authors said.

The researchers studied the behavior of a quarter of a million people using toilets at motorway service stations in Britain over 32 days. Use of soap was monitored by sensors.

The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health to mark Global Handwashing Day, showed that with no reminders, 32 percent of men and 64 percent of women used soap.

The researchers then flashed a series of electronic messages, ranging from &quot;Water doesn&apos;t kill germs, soap does&quot; to &quot;Don&apos;t be a dirty soap dodger,&quot; onto screens at the entrance of the toilets and measured how behavior changed.

The message that produced the strongest positive response was: &quot;Is the person next to you washing with soap?&quot; -- showing that people respond more when they think others were watching.

The researchers also noted &quot;intriguing differences&quot; in the behavior of men and women: While women responded to simple reminders, men tended to react best to messages that invoked disgust, such as &quot;Don&apos;t take the loo with you -- wash with soap,&quot; or &quot;Soap it off or eat it later.&quot;

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Older people who have been infected with or vaccinated against seasonal flu may have a type of immunity produced by cells that protects them from the swine flu virus, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.

They said the pandemic H1N1 virus has parts found in earlier flu strains, and some people past age 60, who may have been exposed to similar viruses in their youth, may have some latent immune cells that protect them.

&quot;These findings indicate that human populations may have some level of existing immunity to the pandemic H1N1 influenza and may explain why the 2009 H1N1-related symptoms have been generally mild,&quot; said Carol Cardona of the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Her study appears in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Cardona said cell-based immunity may be serving to weaken the effects of swine flu.

&quot;The meaning clinically is you are going to get sick but it may not be as severe if you had no immunity whatsoever,&quot; Cardona said in a telephone interview.

Cardona said much attention is given to antibodies that recognize and destroy foreign invaders.

The body also makes cells, known as cytotoxic T-cells, which secrete antiviral chemicals that kill infected cells and clear the virus from the body. It is these cells that may be offering protection.

&quot;It&apos;s part of the primary immune response. It just is not the one that is classically measured,&quot; Cardona said.

Cardona and colleague Zheng Xing analyzed data from prior studies of the H1N1 virus, looking at short stretches of proteins known as epitopes found in regions of the virus that are less likely to change from strain to strain.

&quot;We simply went in and reanalyzed it,&quot; Cardona said.

They found more than a dozen of these epitopes on the H1N1 virus also are found in seasonal flu viruses that have been circulating for years.

&quot;Not every single person can process these stretches of the protein,&quot; said Cardona, which may explain why some people who get the H1N1 flu have severe illness while others have milder cases.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most serious cases and deaths from swine flu have been in people under the age of 65.

&quot;It&apos;s the younger ones who are being hospitalized,&quot; the CDC&apos;s Dr. Tim Uyeki told a meeting of the Pan American Health Organization on Wednesday.

Dr. Yoshi Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin said studies showed people born in 1918 or earlier had many antibodies against the new pandemic H1N1 and said it may more closely resemble its distant 1918 cousin.

Feeling sick? Wondering if it&apos;s the H1N1 flu or just a regular old go-away-don&apos;t-come-near-me, flu?

Face it, your doctor may not be able to squeeze you right in. But you may be able to figure it out using a Web-based self-assessment tool developed by researchers at Emory University in Atlanta. The tool is now available on several national Web sites, including flu.gov , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Microsoft&apos;s H1N1 Response Center .

The online test includes questions like, do you have a fever? Have you been short of breath? Do you have a pain or pressure in your chest that you didn&apos;t have before? Were you feeling better and now a fever or cough is returning?

The H1N1 flu , also widely known as the swine flu, is a fairly new influenza virus that has spread around the world. The CDC reports that it first appeared in the United States this past April. By June 11, the World Health Organization categorized it as a pandemic . Because its extremely contagious, hospitals and health care workers have been bracing for the H1N1 to hit hard this fall.

With concerns about the new flu running high , health care providers expect to get slammed with a mounting wave of people rushing in to find out if they have the H1N1 virus.

The online test, dubbed the Strategy for Off-Site Rapid Triage, is designed to help a lot of people figure out if they need to see their doctor or go to a hospital.

&quot;This Web site is carefully designed to encourage those who are severely ill, and those at increased risk for serious illness, to contact their doctor, while reassuring large numbers of people with a mild illness that it is safe to recover at home,&quot; Arthur Kellermann, professor of emergency medicine and an associate dean at the Emory School of Medicine, said in a statement. &quot;Hopefully, providing easy-to-understand information to the public will reduce the number of people who are needlessly exposed to H1N1 influenza in crowded clinic and ER waiting rooms, and allow America&apos;s doctors and nurses to focus their attention on those who need us most.&quot;

    <body>* Government says healthcare workers believe myths

* Some hospitals fight back with mandatory vaccination

* Fears reflect public doubts about vaccines

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Hospital and other healthcare workers are at the front of the line to get the new swine flu vaccine, but many are resisting and even fighting vaccination requirements.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cannot yet say how many are reluctant to have the shots because the campaign has just started. But the number may be significant given that only about 40 percent of U.S. healthcare workers ever get vaccinated against seasonal influenza.

A vaccination requirement sparked protests in New York this month, and already one lawyer has filed suit to allow staffers to opt out.

Healthcare workers, at high risk of infection with influenza, including swine flu, were the first offered the vaccine against H1N1 in many states that have started vaccinating campaigns over the past two weeks.

&quot;It is extremely important that healthcare workers, as well as all hospital staff, get vaccinated for both H1N1 and seasonal flu,&quot; said Lynnae Mahaney, president of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.

Mahaney&apos;s organization surveyed pharmacy directors at 341 hospitals across the country and found only 37 percent could report vaccination rates of more than 70 percent at their hospitals.

&quot;That&apos;s too low,&quot; said Mahaney.

Healthcare workers such as nurses and technicians often have the same fears the general public has about vaccines -- are they tested, can they give you the flu and can they cause side-effects?

The CDC says these fears are based on myths, but doubts persist.

MANDATORY SHOTS

The Infectious Diseases Society of America has asked for all states to mandate vaccinations for healthcare workers.

&quot;Decades of scientific data demonstrate Food and Drug Administration-approved influenza vaccines to be safe, effective, and cost-saving,&quot; the group said in a statement.

But the U.S. Health and Human Services Department is stressing that the vaccination campaign is voluntary.

Hospital Corp. of America is requiring healthcare workers to get vaccinated, while MedStar, which operates hospitals in the Baltimore-Washington area, requires all staff, including clerical workers, to be immunized.

New York state requires healthcare workers to be vaccinated against flu, but this week attorney Patricia Finn of Piermont, New York, filed for a temporary restraining order against Health Commissioner Dr. Richard Daines.

Finn, whose practice specializes in clients who want to be exempt from vaccine requirements, said her suit represents 60,000 healthcare workers.

Last month some healthcare workers protested in the state capital, Albany. &quot;Let&apos;s unite to oppose mandatory H1N1 vaccinations,&quot; organizers wrote in a Facebook announcement.

British officials are battling similar resistance.

&quot;We all know that uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine among NHS staff is traditionally low,&quot; Ian Dalton, director of flu resilience at the National Health Service, wrote in a letter to chief executives and boards of hospitals quoted by the Guardian newspaper.

&quot;It is an NHS board responsibility that we do not find ourselves in this position with the swine flu vaccine.&quot; (Editing by Xavier Briand and David Storey)</body>

    <body>* Clinical trial suggest one dose won&apos;t ensure protection

* Sanofi only H1N1 vaccine source for young children in U.S.

(Adds details, background)

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Children under 10 years may need two shots of swine flu vaccine to get optimal protection, French drugmaker and the world&apos;s biggest flu vaccine producer Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) said on Wednesday.

A two-dose regimen for H1N1 swine flu would be in line with recommendations for seasonal influenza immunisation in children of this age.

Sanofi said results of a U.S. clinical trial looking at H1N1 vaccination in children aged 6 months through 9 years suggested a single dose may protect many children but &quot;two doses of vaccine will be required for optimal protection&quot;.

Previous results from studies of swine flu vaccines made by Sanofi and other companies have found one dose offers good protection in adults.

In the case of children, however, only 50 percent of those aged 6 to 35 months had adequate protection after a single shot, while 76 percent of children aged 3 to 9 years were protected. That compares with 98 percent of adults who had a good immune response after just one dose.

Sanofi is the only company licensed in the United States to produce a flu vaccine for children as young as 6 months of age.

A total of 474 children were studied in the clinical trial. (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Hans Peters)</body>

    <body>Oct 14 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- Dissent over Canada&apos;s H1N1 vaccination strategy continued to quietly mount in the country&apos;s medical community Tuesday as the top public health official announced the government will temporarily leave nearly 1 million doses of the vaccine on the shelf till early November.

- The acceleration of the U.S. dollar&apos;s decline in recent days is creating anxiety for exporters in Canada, Europe and Japan. But in the search to create a post-crisis economy that is less prone to financial catastrophe, the U.S. dollar&apos;s decline is widely accepted as a necessary ingredient.

BUSINESS:

- China&apos;s energy juggernaut is revving up, boosting global oil demand beyond what was expected and creating an opportunity for Canadian producers now focused on the United States.

- Copper&apos;s strong performance is no longer just a bet on a pickup in industrial activity. Some investors are treating it more like silver, platinum or even gold, buying it as a hedge against currency fluctuations, potential inflation or even as a store of long-term value.

NATIONAL POST:

- Amending the Criminal Code to make euthanasia legal in Canada would likely gain the support of three-quarters of Quebec&apos;s medical specialists, says a new survey that is the latest chapter in a growing debate on physician-assisted suicide.

- Up to 40 Arab, Muslim and other countries critical of Israel plan to turn a routine United Nations meeting on the Middle East on Wednesday into a war crimes debate focused on Israel&apos;s assault on Gaza last winter.

FINANCIAL POST:

- The opening of a 3,456-kilometre-long TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) pipeline is set to boost demand for heavy oil, an added bonus for an industry already enjoying surging crude prices. It will take about three months to fill the Keystone line with oil, long before any of it is refined into finished products.

- Canada could cash in on the battle for climate change should countries around the world spend the trillions of dollars the International Energy Agency contends is necessary to boost carbon capture and storage, it was predicted Tuesday.</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most of the people who have died from the new pandemic H1N1 flu had underlying conditions such as asthma, but 45 percent seemed healthy, according to the largest study yet of U.S. cases.

Children with sickle cell and other blood diseases have a special risk from the swine flu, just as they do from seasonal influenza, Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.

She said injectable versions of the flu vaccine -- suitable for babies, people with asthma and people 50 and older -- will be available this week.

Schuchat said the CDC collected detailed data on 1,400 adults and 500 children hospitalized with swine flu in 10 states. The findings confirm that most serious cases and deaths have been in people under the age of 65.

&quot;The vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths are occurring in younger people,&quot; Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing. Five more children have died, bringing the H1N1 death toll among children in the United States to 81.

She said 55 percent of the adults had a condition known to worsen flu of all kinds. &quot;In adults, the most common underlying conditions were asthma and chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease and immunosuppression,&quot; Schuchat said.

Six percent were pregnant. Pregnant women have suppressed immune systems so their bodies do not reject the baby, and may also have pressure on the lungs from the fetus.

&quot;And in children, the most common underlying conditions were asthma and chronic lung disease, neurological or neuromuscular diseases, and sickle cell or other blood disorders.&quot;

Schuchat said 5.8 percent of hospitalized children had a blood disease related to red blood cells, such as sickle cell disease.

The CDC had not mentioned sickle cell disease before as a special risk, but such children had been highlighted in influenza guidelines as being at special risk and needing to be vaccinated every year.

9.8 MILLION DOSES

Schuchat said the vaccination program was continuing slowly. The CDC has opted to start immunizing people as soon as vaccine becomes available, which means supply has been spotty.

&quot;As of yesterday, 9.8 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine were available to be ordered,&quot; Schuchat said. States have ordered 5.8 million of these doses to go to providers.

&quot;I&apos;m happy to say that about half of the vaccine that&apos;s available for order is now the injectable form,&quot; she said.

So far the vaccine available for swine flu has been only AstraZeneca unit MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray vaccine, which is only approved for people aged 2 to 49 without asthma or other lung conditions. States have been giving it to healthcare workers or older children.

Schuchat agreed that some places had experienced trouble getting either H1N1 or seasonal influenza vaccine quickly.

&quot;It does take time to process the orders, to package them for the right amounts that are heading out toward the many sites we&apos;ll be delivering vaccine, and this is going to be ongoing over the next days and weeks,&quot; she said.

Vaccine would be more widely available at the end of October, Schuchat said.

She said there was no rush for people to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza.

&quot;Right now we&apos;re seeing the H1N1 strains. We aren&apos;t seeing much at all of the seasonal strains. And we think there&apos;s time to be vaccinated against the seasonal flu. Even if more vaccine isn&apos;t available until November or December, we think it will be just fine to be vaccinated then,&quot; she said.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada has less than 1 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine ready for distribution, not enough to move up the start of its vaccination program, one of the country&apos;s top health officials said on Tuesday.

Country-wide vaccination remains on track to begin in the first week of November, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said in a conference call with journalists.

&quot;It will move out very quickly in the next few weeks,&quot; he said. &quot;The timeline is primarily based on the availability of the vaccine.&quot;

Canada, which has a population of 33.6 million people, has ordered 50.4 million doses of vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline.

The vaccination program won&apos;t begin until Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq authorizes it, following clinical trials that begin this week and a review of studies from Canada and elsewhere, Butler-Jones said.

There are no plans to begin vaccinations sooner in the Pacific Coast province of British Columbia, he said, where some outbreaks of pandemic H1N1 flu have occurred this fall. Also called swine flu, the strain has hospitalized 93 people in the province and killed seven, according to the B.C. Center for Disease Control.

&quot;The provinces and territories are doing all the work to put it in place so you can, rather than piecemeal, deliver an effective vaccine (program) for the whole country,&quot; Butler-Jones said. &quot;It&apos;s a huge undertaking, so we want to get it right.&quot;

A new study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal said on Tuesday that rapid roll-out of vaccines is effective in reducing the infection rate of the H1N1 pandemic virus. The study reported on a simulation model of an outbreak that projected how many people would be infected under different disease control strategies.

&quot;It&apos;s never too late (to vaccinate) and any disease averted is an important thing to do,&quot; Butler-Jones said when asked if the findings raised concerns about Canada&apos;s timing.

Seventy-nine people have died in Canada from the H1N1 strain.

    <body>JERUSALEM, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Israeli vaccine maker NasVax Ltd (NSVX.TA) reported on Tuesday positive results of preclinical trials of its vaccine against the H1N1 flu strain.

The company said experiments showed that mice immunised with its VaxiSome swine flu vaccine had higher levels of the hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) serum antibody, which is an indicator of the efficacy of influenza vaccines.

NasVax said given the positive results it would continue to develop VaxiSome.

    <body>* H1N1 vaccine production at maximum capacity

* Shrugs off any plasma oversupply

* Shares up 1.6 percent (Adds CEO comments)

MELBOURNE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Australian blood products and vaccines maker CSL Ltd (CSL.AX) warned on Wednesday its full year profit could fall as much as 16 percent if the U.S. dollar remains weak, but shrugged off signs of weaker plasma product prices.

The company also said was producing as much H1N1 flu vaccine as it could.

&quot;We actually aren&apos;t looking for new orders, to be frank,&quot; Chief Executive Brian McNamee said on Wednesday after the group&apos;s annual meeting.

&quot;We&apos;re pretty maxed out with capacity.&quot;

The company has flagged it expects H1N1 vaccine sales, including $180 million in sales to the U.S. government, to be a big contributor to its growth this year, based on last year&apos;s prevailing currency rates.

CSL shares rose 1.6 percent to A$32.21, beating gains in the broader market. The shares have underperformed the market sharply so far this year as investors shifted into cyclical stocks.

Based on Oct. 9 currency rates, CSL expects full year profit to fall to between A$970 million ($880 million) and A$1.07 billion, from A$1.15 billion last year. First-quarter trading was in line with its expectations.

Analysts on average were projecting a slight fall in net profit to A$1.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Based on last year&apos;s currency rates, the company, which competes against Baxter Inc (BAX.N) and Grifols (GRLS.MC), maintained its full year profit forecast for growth of up to 10 percent.

McNamee was sanguine about any slight fall in plasma product prices due to growing supply, saying smaller companies which have a higher cost structure and produce fewer products would find it hard to grow, while CSL was still expanding.

&quot;We don&apos;t see the prices going up, certainly. Could the prices soften a dollar or two? Sure, but that&apos;s immaterial to us,&quot; he said. (Reporting by Sonali Paul)</body>

    <body>Oct 13 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL:

- More than two-thirds of those who have fallen critically ill and died of H1N1 influenza in Canada are younger women, according to a startling new study that underscores that while the pandemic flu is mild overall, in selective cases it is brutal and lethal.

- In the latest blow to Gordon Brown&apos;s beleaguered leadership, the British Prime Minister is being forced to repay over $19,000 in disputed claims following an audit into how British lawmakers spent public money.

- Pakistan is hastening its planned offensive against Islamic extremists in the country&apos;s Waziristan region, officials revealed, as another bomb attack killed 41 people.

Report on Business Section:

- Magna International is expected to become Opel&apos;s owner this week, a month earlier than expected, in spite of fierce resistance from Spain and Britain to the auto maker&apos;s German bailout package.

NATIONAL POST:

- A virus linked to prostate cancer also appears to play a role in chronic fatigue syndrome, according to research that could lead to the first drug treatments for a mysterious disorder that affects 17 million people worldwide.

- Two parents and their teenage daughter were among four people killed this Thanksgiving weekend when the small plane they were flying crashed in Ontario&apos;s Algonquin Provincial Park.

Efforts were underway Sunday to retrieve the victims&apos; bodies from the crash site, a wooded area near Devine Lake that was only accessible by air, police said.

- The &quot;unbelievable honor&quot; of being awarded the Nobel prize in economic sciences is amplified for American Elinor Ostrom by the fact that she is the first woman recipient.

Ostrom said she has attended economics conferences where she has been the only woman in the room, but the ratio of women to men in her field is slowly changing. &quot;I would hope that the recognition here is helping that along,&quot; she said.

FINANCIAL POST:

- Although trade in global currency markets was lackluster with holidays in Canada, the United States and Japan, the Canadian dollar continued to get a boost from strong demand for oil and other commodities, as well as Canada&apos;s relatively robust economy compared to its still-ailing neighbor to the south.

- RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust (REI_u.TO), the largest real estate investment trust in the country, is getting closer to a major move into the United States -- even getting RBC Dominion Securities&apos; opinion on a potential deal.</body>

    <summary>... So far, 76 people in England have died from the H1N1 swine flu virus, which the World Health Organization has classified as a pandemic, as well as a further 10 ...</summary>
    <body>LONDON (Reuters Life!) - An animal rights poster promoting vegetarianism was banned by Britain&apos;s Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) on Wednesday for wrongly implying that eating meat caused swine flu.

The agency said the poster -- on which the words &quot;meat kills&quot; and &quot;go vegetarian&quot; were transposed over the names of deadly diseases, of which swine flu featured most prominently -- was misleading and could cause undue fear and distress.

So far, 76 people in England have died from the H1N1 swine flu virus, which the World Health Organization has classified as a pandemic, as well as a further 10 in Scotland, three in Northern Ireland and one in Wales.

In response to a complaint from a member of the public, UK-based animal rights charity People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who produced the poster, said it was not intended to suggest that eating meat caused swine flu, but to make people think about the consequences of livestock production and confining animals to factory farms.

PETA said the poster highlighted that reducing meat consumption was one of the best ways to prevent the development and spread of deadly diseases that originated from such practices.

But the ASA noted that of the four diseases referred to on the poster -- E. coli, mad cow, swine flu and MRSA -- only two were known to have originated from eating meat, and said the advert could cause some readers to wrongly infer swine flu could be caught in this way.

&quot;Although we understood the intention was to refer to livestock and meat production rather than just eating meat, we considered that the message was, at best, ambiguous,&quot; the ASA said, banning the poster from appearing again in the same form.

    <body>ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - U.S. economic data is too patchy, slow and subject to large revisions, making it hard to understand in a timely fashion what is happening in the economy, a Treasury Department official said on Monday.

Alan Krueger, assistant secretary for economic policy, said those data limitations caused headaches for policymakers trying to spot potential problems or decide how to address them.

&quot;Some of our higher-frequency gauges are insufficiently timely,&quot; he said at an economics conference here. &quot;It is as if you only had a speedometer that told you your speed five minutes ago.&quot;

Krueger proposed creating a &quot;rapid response&quot; data gathering program that could collect information tailored to answer specific questions.

In the current financial crisis, for example, such a system could look at whether the &quot;cash for clunkers&quot; auto sales incentive program cannibalized sales from other sectors. It might also be used to measure the economic impact of the H1N1 flu outbreak.

He said the financial crisis exposed several key holes in available economic information, including details on hedge fund positions and linkages between financial Institutions.

Regulatory reforms that President Barack Obama proposed would address some of those problems by requiring hedge funds to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and putting derivatives onto an exchange, he said.

&quot;Some of the most pressing gaps that surfaced in our financial data in the last year, such as counterparty risks in the derivatives market, would be addressed if the administration&apos;s regulatory reform proposals were enacted,&quot; Krueger said. &quot;But new gaps in the data infrastructure will likely arise as the financial sector evolves.&quot;

He urged more funding for statistical offices and greater collaboration with private researchers to share useful databases.

&quot;I think we would all agree that it is a capital mistake if we do not make efforts to enhance our economic data to improve policymaking and to prevent future financial crisis if these enhancements could be had at little or no additional expense,&quot; he said.

    <body>By Edmund Blair

CAIRO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Egypt is developing its own vaccine against H1N1 swine flu for production in 2011 and, in the meantime, will import vaccines to inoculate school children and key public workers, the health minister said.

Experts fear a flu pandemic could have a devastating impact on Egypt, a country of 77 million people who mostly live in the densely packed Nile Valley. Many are in Cairo&apos;s crowded slums.

Egypt, already hard hit by the more deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, has found about 1,030 cases of H1N1 flu, widely known as swine flu, and three people have died from the virus, Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali said late on Sunday.

&quot;We have a plan to produce the first batch (of Egypt&apos;s H1N1 flu vaccine) by April 2011,&quot; Gabali said, speaking after a talk about healthcare reform.

A 35-strong team of experts had been assembled from around Egypt to develop the vaccine, the minister told Reuters.

&quot;We are working now in the lab,&quot; he said. &quot;They (the team) were people working in independent institutions, around Egypt. They have trained overseas but they have not worked together as a team. They have the skills to develop the vaccine.&quot;

&quot;The production (of) the first batch will be about 6,000 units and it will be tested for efficacy around the second quarter of 2011,&quot; he said.

Output from the factory, to be built in Sixth of October City on the outskirts of Cairo, would meet demand in Egypt but could also supply other countries in Africa, he said.

VACCINATING STUDENTS

Other countries, including developing nations, are working to produce their own vaccines, but Egypt has not so far been mentioned among them by the World Health Organisation.

&quot;We are working closely with the WHO and they want us to expand our capacity and we will do that,&quot; Gabali said.

In the meantime, Gabali said Egypt had contracted to buy about 5 million vaccines and requested that the WHO provide 15 million from its stock, with an additional 5 million vaccines coming from the private sector.

&quot;My target is to vaccinate all the students, which are about 20 million, and then the rest of the 10 million will be those in critical jobs that affect the public life daily,&quot; he said.

He said the focus would be school children from kindergarten age to secondary school.

WHO said Monday about 100 low- and middle-income nations would receive H1N1 flu vaccines donated by firms such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Sanofi (SASY.PA). Vaccines could be sent as early as next month, it said.

Egypt has stepped up surveillance at airports to detect anyone arriving with H1N1 flu and put in place measures to trace them if they fall ill during their stay. It has also campaigned to improve hygiene at schools, which opened late this year. (Editing by Dominic Evans)</body>

VACCINATING STUDENTS

Other countries, including developing nations, are also working to produce their own vaccines in expectation that global supplies from pharmaceutical giants like GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis will be quickly spoken for.

The World Health Organization has given Egyptian national producer Vacsera a seed grant and technical guidance to ramp up its capacity to eventually make flu vaccine.

&quot;We are working closely with the WHO and they want us to expand our capacity and we will do that,&quot; Gabali said.

In the meantime, Gabali said Egypt had contracted to buy about 5 million vaccines and requested that the WHO provide 15 million from its stock, with an additional 5 million vaccines coming from the private sector.

He spoke of vaccinating a total of 30 million people. &quot;My target is to vaccinate all the students, which are about 20 million, and then the rest of the 10 million will be those in critical jobs that affect the public life daily.&quot;

Gabali said the focus would be school children from kindergarten age to secondary school.

Other countries, including developing nations, are also working to produce their own vaccines in expectation that global supplies from pharmaceutical giants like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) will be quickly spoken for.

The World Health Organisation has given Egyptian national producer Vacsera a seed grant and technical guidance to ramp up its capacity to eventually make flu vaccine.

&quot;We are working closely with the WHO and they want us to expand our capacity and we will do that,&quot; Gabali said.

In the meantime, Gabali said Egypt had contracted to buy about 5 million vaccines and requested that the WHO provide 15 million from its stock, with an additional 5 million vaccines coming from the private sector.

He spoke of vaccinating a total of 30 million people. &quot;My target is to vaccinate all the students, which are about 20 million, and then the rest of the 10 million will be those in critical jobs that affect the public life daily.&quot;

Gabali said the focus would be school children from kindergarten age to secondary school.

WHO said Monday about 100 low- and middle-income nations would receive H1N1 flu vaccines donated by firms such as GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi. Vaccines could be sent as early as next month, it said.

Egypt has stepped up surveillance at airports to detect anyone arriving with H1N1 flu and put in place measures to trace them if they fall ill during their stay. It has also campaigned to improve hygiene at schools, which opened late this year. (Additional reporting by Laura MacInnis in Geneva; Editing by Dominic Evans)</body>

CAIRO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Egypt is developing its own vaccine against H1N1 swine flu for production in 2011 and, in the meantime, will import vaccines to inoculate school children and key public workers, the health minister said.

Experts fear a flu pandemic could have a devastating impact on Egypt, a country of 77 million people who mostly live in the densely packed Nile Valley. Many are in Cairo&apos;s crowded slums.

Egypt, already hard hit by the more deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, has found about 1,030 cases of H1N1 flu, widely known as swine flu, and three people have died from the virus, Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali said late on Sunday.

&quot;We have a plan to produce the first batch (of Egypt&apos;s H1N1 flu vaccine) by April 2011,&quot; Gabali said, speaking after a talk about healthcare reform.

A 35-strong team of experts had been assembled from around Egypt to develop the vaccine, the minister told Reuters.

&quot;We are working now in the lab,&quot; he said. &quot;They (the team) were people working in independent institutions, around Egypt. They have trained overseas but they have not worked together as a team. They have the skills to develop the vaccine.&quot;

&quot;The production (of) the first batch will be about 6,000 units and it will be tested for efficacy around the second quarter of 2011,&quot; he said.

Output from the factory, to be built in Sixth of October City on the outskirts of Cairo, would meet demand in Egypt but could also supply other countries in Africa, he said.

VACCINATING STUDENTS

Other countries, including developing nations, are also working to produce their own vaccines in expectation that global supplies from pharmaceutical giants like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) will be quickly spoken for.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation plans to start sending H1N1 flu vaccines to poorer countries as early as next month, the United Nations agency&apos;s head of vaccine research said on Monday.

Marie-Paule Kieny said about 100 low- and middle-income nations would receive the vaccines donated by companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi, as well as related supplies such as syringes.

&quot;We are trying to have a first delivery starting in November,&quot; she told journalists in Geneva. &quot;The idea is to start with northern hemisphere countries first.&quot;

The WHO declared in June that a full pandemic was underway from the virus widely known as swine flu. It has killed at least 4,500 people so far but caused mainly mild to moderate effects in most patients as it spread around the world.

Kieny said it was critical that health workers in poorer countries get protected against the virus to avoid passing it to the patients they treat and to ensure that hospitals and health clinics can stay open throughout an outbreak.

China began the world&apos;s first mass vaccination program in late September, followed by Australia and the United States.

Kieny said the vaccines that have been quickly developed in response to the H1N1 strain are yielding more volume than first expected, raising hopes about the total quantity of shots that could be made available.

Work is underway to determine the exact production capacity of vaccine manufacturers worldwide, the expert said.

She signaled one dose of the vaccine could be enough to ensure protection against the flu strain, which does not appear to have morphed into a more virulent or milder form since its emergence in the United States and Mexico.

&quot;All the data that we have seen show that one dose is sufficient,&quot; she said.

Last week, the U.N. agency said it could take years for the H1N1 infection rate to slow down. Once enough people have been exposed to the virus or have gained protection from vaccination, it could act more as a seasonal flu instead of a pandemic one, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said.</body>

GENEVA, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation plans to start sending H1N1 flu vaccines to poorer countries as early as next month, the United Nations agency&apos;s head of vaccine research said on Monday.

Marie-Paule Kieny said about 100 low- and middle-income nations would receive the vaccines donated by companies such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Sanofi (SASY.PA), as well as related supplies such as syringes.

&quot;We are trying to have a first delivery starting in November,&quot; she told journalists in Geneva. &quot;The idea is to start with northern hemisphere countries first.&quot;

The WHO declared in June [ID:nLC321991] that a full pandemic was underway from the virus widely known as swine flu. It has killed at least 4,500 people so far but caused mainly mild to moderate effects in most patients as it spread around the world.

Kieny said it was critical that health workers in poorer countries get protected against the virus to avoid passing it to the patients they treat and to ensure that hospitals and health clinics can stay open throughout an outbreak.

China began the world&apos;s first mass vaccination programme in late September, followed by Australia and the United States.

Kieny said the vaccines that have been quickly developed in response to the H1N1 strain are yielding more volume than first expected, raising hopes about the total quantity of shots that could be made available.

Work is underway to determine the exact production capacity of vaccine manufacturers worldwide, the expert said.

    <summary>... If the second wave of H1N1 now spreading across the United States is more severe or broad-based, it may mean some patients will not get the critical life ...</summary>
    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Once swine flu patients are sick enough to need hospital care, they decline very fast, requiring ventilators and advanced treatments that quickly strain scarce hospital resources, several teams reported on Monday.

Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association they paint a picture of how younger, previously healthy people quickly developed severe respiratory failure, forcing doctors to use extreme measures to save them.

&quot;The fact that they develop this very rapid, very severe respiratory failure means hospitals need to be prepared to manage these patients at any time of the day or night,&quot; said Doug White of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who wrote a commentary in the journal.

He said although the outbreaks in Canada and Mexico were relatively mild, they consumed a vast amounts of life-saving therapies.

If the second wave of H1N1 now spreading across the United States is more severe or broad-based, it may mean some patients will not get the critical life support they need, White said in a telephone interview.

&quot;Saying no will mean they will die,&quot; he said.

&apos;MAXED OUT&apos;

&quot;This is one of the most difficult conditions I&apos;ve ever had to treat,&quot; said Dr. Anand Kumar of St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba, a hotspot of infection during the first wave of the swine flu in May and June.

Kumar said he normally sees only a few patients a year who become severely ill from an infection.

&quot;In the case of Winnipeg, we saw 40 people on ventilators struggling for their lives simultaneously. It&apos;s a bizarre and somewhat frightening experience,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.

&quot;At one point, 50 percent of the available ICU (intensive care unit) beds in the entire city were filled with H1N1 patients,&quot; Kumar said. &quot;We basically maxed out our capacity.&quot;

While 95 percent of the patients he studied had some underlying risk factor, most of these were very common, such as asthma, smoking, obesity or high blood pressure.

&quot;If you&apos;d asked them, they would have said, &apos;Yes, I&apos;m a pretty healthy person.&apos; That is surprising to me,&quot; he said.

Researchers studying the outbreak in Mexico between March and June 2009 had similar experiences.

They saw critical illness mostly among younger people, who developed severe respiratory failure. About 40 percent of them died.

SALVAGE THERAPY

To help some of the very sickest patients who were struggling to breathe even with the assistance of a mechanical ventilator, researchers in Australia and New Zealand tried a type of life support called ECMO that adds oxygen to blood and circulates it throughout the body.

&quot;Despite their illness severity and the prolonged use of life support, most of these patients survived,&quot; Dr. Andrew Davies of the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne and colleagues wrote.

Kumar said doctors in Winnipeg used the system for some of their patients who were struggling despite being on ventilators.

&quot;In about 15 to 20 percent of our patients, had to use salvage therapies - basically, stuff that is unproven. But you use them because you&apos;ve got nothing left,&quot; Kumar said.

Kumar said most people who get H1N1 will not have severe disease, which he said only occurs in about 1 in 1,000 patients. &quot;The problem is, if you get half of your population with H1N1, that can turn into a lot of really sick people.&quot;</body>

    <summary>... Tamiflu is made by Roche &lt;ROG.VX&gt; and Gilead Sciences Inc &lt;GILD.O&gt; and is one of two drugs shown to work well against H1N1 swine flu. ...</summary>
    <body>HONG KONG, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Vietnam has detected three cases of swine flu that were resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu, but an expert said there was no evidence the mutant strains had infected other people.

The three were admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh city in late August and September and have all recovered, said Rogier van Doorn, a clinical microbiologist and doctor at the hospital.

&quot;The viruses that were isolated when they were admitted were still sensitive (to the drug), but during treatment with oseltamivir, resistance built up,&quot; said van Doorn, referring to the generic form of Tamiflu.

&quot;So it was not transmission of resistant viruses, but we observed that it developed during treatment of these three patients ... we have no evidence to show that (there was further transmission of resistant viruses),&quot; he told Reuters.

Tamiflu is made by Roche (ROG.VX) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and is one of two drugs shown to work well against H1N1 swine flu.

The three drug-resistant cases were among more than 600 H1N1 patients who were treated at the hospital.

Two of the patients had very mild disease and the third, a 3-year-old child, was admitted to intensive care but made a full recovery within 10 days.

Tamiflu-resistant swine flu cases have been reported in Japan, Hong Kong, Denmark and the United States.

Flu viruses are mutation-prone and experts are not surprised that they would evolve resistance, just as bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics.

However, experts fear such resistance may spread and complicate efforts to treat victims with the approach of what is likely to be a second wave of swine flu infections as the Northern Hemisphere enters the winter season. (Reporting by Tan Ee Lyn; Editing by Alex Richardson)</body>

    <summary>... England Journal of Medicine, hope their findings can help northern hemisphere countries prepare for an expected onslaught from a second wave of H1N1 infections ...</summary>
    <body>HONG KONG, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Swine flu sent 722 people into intensive care units during the winter months in Australia and New Zealand, far more than during a normal flu season, and many of them were infants, pregnant or obese, a study published on Friday found.

&quot;Normally, we would only be seeing maybe 30 to 40 patients admitted to intensive care with the flu, it is actually very rare to come to intensive care because of the flu,&quot; said one of the researchers, Ian Seppelt, at the Sydney Medical School.

&quot;But this year we saw a large number of younger people who were critically ill and who needed intensive care resources,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone.

The researchers, who published their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine, hope their findings can help northern hemisphere countries prepare for an expected onslaught from a second wave of H1N1 infections.

&quot;We can give some indication what to expect in terms of numbers and resource requirements. What we saw was certainly a major stress on the intensive care system ... 20 percent of ICU beds were required by H1N1 patients,&quot; Seppelt added.

The study overed the period from June to August, the southern hemisphere winter.

While pregnant women make up only 1 percent of the general population in Australia and New Zealand, 66 of the 722 ICU patients, or 9.1 percent, were pregnant women.

Similarly, while 5.3 percent of the Australian population have a body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 and are regarded as obese, 28.6 percent of the H1N1 patients admitted to ICUs had a BMI of over 35.

An estimated 13 percent of people in the general population have asthma or other chronic pulmonary disease, but 32.7 percent of people admitted to ICUs had these underlying conditions.

&quot;Those patients were over-represented ... that&apos;s quite disproportionate,&quot; Seppelt said.

The study, which pooled together information provided by 187 ICU centres in Australia and New Zealand, also highlighted other interesting details.

&quot;Our data indicate that the greatest effect on ICU resources in a given region occurs approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the first confirmed winter ICU admission and the extra workload lasts several weeks,&quot; the researchers wrote.

Julian Tang, consultant and virologist at the National University Hospital in Singapore, and who was not connected to the study, said the second H1N1 wave would affect more people because none of them would have any existing immunity to this pandemic virus.

&quot;Despite a very low expected case-fatality rate from this virus, the larger number of symptomatic infections may cause some additional burden on healthcare services,&quot; he told Reuters.

&quot;Widespread vaccination may reduce the number of such symptomatic cases and therefore reduce the social and economic consequences of this.&quot; (Reporting by Tan Ee Lyn; Editing by Ken Wills and Alex Richardson)</body>

By David Morgan

LANDOVER, Maryland, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. government media event to promote H1N1 school vaccinations on Friday included VIPs, cute kids and a phalanx of television cameras -- but only one in five children at the school had proper parental consent to get immunized.

&quot;This school was ready to go,&quot; Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius declared after touring a makeshift vaccination clinic in the cafeteria at Dodge Park Elementary School, near Washington.

But 80 percent of the student body were ineligible for vaccinations due to missing paperwork during the day-long swine flu clinic.

Federal officials did not want to discuss the turnout. It underscored the challenge facing the U.S. government&apos;s $6.4 billion immunization effort which involves the widespread use of schools as vaccine clinics for the first time in a generation.

H1N1 poses a greater danger of severe illness and death for children and young people than seasonal flu, which is particularly dangerous for the elderly.

Only about 20 percent of U.S. children get vaccinated against seasonal flu in a typical year. Some parents, including many at Dodge Park Elementary, are holding back on H1N1 vaccination because of worries about the newness of the vaccine -- concerns that health officials say are unfounded.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday that 76 U.S. children have died from H1N1 since April, with widespread swine flu in 37 states.

Most victims had underlying disease but 20 to 30 percent were healthy before they contracted swine flu.

This death toll compares with 46 to 88 pediatric deaths for entire flu seasons over the past three years, the CDC said.

250 MILLION DOSES

Dodge Park is among the first schools in the United States to serve as a clinic for student vaccinations as the government rolls out up to 250 million doses of vaccine by year end.

There will be some 90,000 vaccination sites nationwide including doctors&apos; offices, clinics, hospitals and stores.

Federal officials have cautioned that the early weeks of the immunization program could be bumpy as state and local health departments cope with the strain.

One problem at Dodge Park was bureaucratic. Dozens of children could not get immunized because their parents submitted incomplete consent forms, officials said.

Another was that the only vaccine on offer was AstraZeneca (AZN.L) unit MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray, which is unsuitable for children with underlying conditions such as asthma. Injectable vaccine is due to become available next week.

But school officials said the main barrier was the safety concern.

&quot;Many parents are not comfortable with it. They&apos;d like to see more testing,&quot; school nurse Irene Campbell explained after helping to immunize 107 students out of a student body of 510.

Popular safety concerns are frustrating for public health officials, who say clinical trials show the new vaccine to be as safe and effective as seasonal flu vaccinations.

&quot;It&apos;s very safe. Although the virus is new, the vaccine is not new. It&apos;s made exactly the way seasonal flu is made year in and year out,&quot; Sebelius said.

The Obama administration has ordered vaccine from five companies: Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and MedImmune. (Editing by Maggie Fox and Alan Elsner)</body>

LANDOVER, Maryland, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. government media event to promote H1N1 school vaccinations on Friday included VIPs, cute kids and a phalanx of television cameras -- but only one in five children at the school had proper parental consent to get immunized.

&quot;This school was ready to go,&quot; Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius declared after touring a makeshift vaccination clinic in the cafeteria at Dodge Park Elementary School, near Washington.

But 80 percent of the student body were ineligible for vaccinations due to missing paperwork during the day-long swine flu clinic.

Health and Human Services spokeswoman Jenny Backus said the turnout was impressive because parents had only a few days to fill out and return consent forms. &quot;Hopefully, today&apos;s experience will help other parents see how easy it is to get their child protected against the flu,&quot; she said.

But the small numbers also underscored the challenge facing the U.S. government&apos;s $6.4 billion immunization effort which involves the widespread use of schools as vaccine clinics for the first time in a generation.

H1N1 poses a greater danger of severe illness and death for children and young people than seasonal flu, which is particularly dangerous for the elderly.

Only about 20 percent of U.S. children get vaccinated against seasonal flu in a typical year. Some parents, including many at Dodge Park Elementary, are holding back on H1N1 vaccination because of worries about the newness of the vaccine -- concerns that health officials say are unfounded.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday that 76 U.S. children have died from H1N1 since April, with widespread swine flu in 37 states.

Most victims had underlying disease but 20 to 30 percent were healthy before they contracted swine flu.

This death toll compares with 46 to 88 pediatric deaths for entire flu seasons over the past three years, the CDC said.

250 MILLION DOSES

Dodge Park is among the first schools in the United States to serve as a clinic for student vaccinations as the government rolls out up to 250 million doses of vaccine by year end.

There will be some 90,000 vaccination sites nationwide including doctors&apos; offices, clinics, hospitals and stores.

Federal officials have cautioned that the early weeks of the immunization program could be bumpy as state and local health departments cope with the strain.

One problem at Dodge Park was bureaucratic. Dozens of children could not get immunized because their parents submitted incomplete consent forms, officials said.

Another was that the only vaccine on offer was AstraZeneca (AZN.L) unit MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray, which is unsuitable for children with underlying conditions such as asthma. Injectable vaccine is due to become available next week.

But school officials said the main barrier was the safety concern.

&quot;Many parents are not comfortable with it. They&apos;d like to see more testing,&quot; school nurse Irene Campbell explained after helping to immunize 107 students out of a student body of 510.

Popular safety concerns are frustrating for public health officials, who say clinical trials show the new vaccine to be as safe and effective as seasonal flu vaccinations.

&quot;It&apos;s very safe. Although the virus is new, the vaccine is not new. It&apos;s made exactly the way seasonal flu is made year in and year out,&quot; Sebelius said.

The Obama administration has ordered vaccine from five companies: Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and MedImmune. (Editing by Maggie Fox and Alan Elsner)</body>

GENEVA (Reuters) - It could take years for the World Health Organization to downgrade the H1N1 flu from a pandemic to seasonal-like virus, the U.N. agency said on Friday.

The WHO moved its six-point pandemic alert level to the top rung in June in response to the spread of the new virus widely known as swine flu, which has killed at least 4,500 people, especially in North America.

WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said that health warning would stay in place until people can better fend off infection from the H1N1 strain.

&quot;At some point in the future, there would be a recognition of the fact that if it&apos;s no longer circulating on a sustainable basis in communities. Then you would lower the pandemic level,&quot; he said, while stressing: &quot;There is absolutely no indication yet of that happening.&quot;

In previous pandemics, Hartl said, it has taken time for worrisome flu strains to become less contagious. The slowdown generally comes from people having some prior exposure to the virus or gaining protection from a vaccine.

&quot;Eventually a pandemic virus becomes more like a seasonal virus and that normally will take something like two to three years,&quot; Hartl said. &quot;Once enough people either have been vaccinated or have contracted the virus, then it becomes more difficult to spread. It starts acting like a seasonal flu.&quot;

National health authorities conduct regular monitoring of flu viruses and research on the circulating strains is used by pharmaceutical companies who sell seasonal flu shots, which normally contain a mixture of a few viruses.

GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Baxter, AstraZeneca and CSL are among the firms now scrambling to develop and sell H1N1 flu shots, yielding them billions of dollars in government orders. China began the world&apos;s first mass vaccination program in late September and Australia and the United States have also launched campaigns targeting children and health workers first.

Hartl said there was no sign yet that the pandemic strain had mutated into a more dangerous or more mild form than the one first identified in Mexico and the United States.

&quot;So far the virus has remained quite homogenous,&quot; he said.

In its latest snapshot of the spreading virus, also released on Friday, the WHO said there has been an unusually early start of flu-like illness in the northern hemisphere this autumn.

Influenza viruses thrive in colder climates and normally pack the biggest punch in winter.

In recent weeks some countries in Europe seen higher than normal respiratory disease activity and Japan&apos;s flu pattern is above its, especially in big cities. The United States, Mexico and Canada have also had higher than normal illness rates for the time of year, the WHO said in the statement.

Flu transmission has stayed steady in tropical parts of the Americas and Asia, with &quot;high intensity respiratory diseases activity&quot; reported in Colombia, Cuba and El Salvador.

But in the southern hemisphere, flu infections have waned with the end of the winter season, the WHO said, describing subsided transmission in Chile, Argentina and New Zealand and falling rates of illness in South Africa and Australia.

    <title>Senate approves 8 percent boost in US nutrition funds</title>

    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate sent President Barack Obama a bill to boost spending on U.S. public nutrition programs, including food stamps and school lunch, by 8 percent, a reflection of the economic recession, on Thursday.

The bill would allow the government to compensate poor families for lunches missed if schools are closed due to an H1N1 flu outbreak. Based on the local school lunch price, the aid would be worth $13-$14 a week per child.

Nutrition programs would get $82.8 billion for the fiscal year that opened on Oct 1, up 8 percent from fiscal 2009. Nutrition accounts for two-thirds of the money in the $121 billion Agriculture Department spending bill.

Senators gave final congressional approval to the bill, 76-22, a day after the House passed it, 263-162. The bill is a compromise of versions passed by each chamber.

Food stamps, which help poor people buy food, would get $58.3 billion for this fiscal year, up $4.3 billion. A record 35.85 million people received benefits at latest count, nearly one in eight Americans.

Child nutrition program, which include school lunch and breakfast, would receive $16.9 billion, a $1.9 billion increase, and the Women, Infants and Children program would get $7.25 billion, up $398 million.

If schools are closed for at least five days in a row due to a pandemic, the government could compensate families with children who receive free or reduced-price lunches under an initiative in the bill.

Earlier this year, USDA said schools could provide lunches in &quot;either pick-up or delivery models&quot; if they wish when classes are canceled due to an H1N1 flu outbreak.

Also in the bill are:

-- $350 billion in aid for dairy farmers, who face the lowest farm-gate price for milk in three decades. USDA will decide how to apportion $290 million in aid directly to farmers. The remaining $60 million will buy cheese and other dairy products for donation to food banks. Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin said milk prices are below the cost of production for most producers;

-- a resolution to a two-year-old ban on imports of poultry meat processed in China. USDA must inspect Chinese plants before shipments are allowed, must conduct audits annually and step up inspections of their products at U.S. ports of entry;

-- a minimal $5.3 million for a livestock tracking system. The traceback plan was embraced as a response to discovery of the first U.S. case of mad cow disease. Lawmakers say USDA showed inconsistent leadership and the system is far from ready to operate.

&quot;If significant progress is not made, (we) will consider eliminating funding for the program,&quot; said the House and Senate negotiators who wrote the final version of the bill.

* Steep U.S. price increases support sector revenues

* Swine flu orders give European companies year-end boost

By Ben Hirschler

LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - It is turning out to be a better year for Big Pharma than initially feared, thanks to hefty drug price increases and windfall sales from swine flu.

What&apos;s more, the industry dodged a bullet over the summer on U.S. healthcare reform, leaving company executives relatively upbeat going into the third-quarter reporting season, which kicks off next week.

The long-term problems have not gone away, with companies facing record losses to generics over the next four years, threatening a yawning gap in future sales and driving sector valuations to a steep discount to the wider market.

But pharmaceuticals have shown their defensive colours in the downturn, with no sign yet of a late-cycle hit to revenues.

&quot;Our initial view was that we would see something by the third quarter, but it is starting to feel like that is not going to happen,&quot; said UBS analyst Gbola Amusa.

Drug sales, in fact, are now expected to grow by 4.5-5.5 percent this year in the all-important U.S. market, according to IMS Health, the leading tracker of prescription drug data. [ID:nL8109273]

Only six months ago, IMS was predicting a 1-2 percent fall.

Resilient demand for medicines means pharmacies have been forced to rebuild inventories that were slashed late last year and drugmakers have pushed through steep price increases, despite the struggling economy.

Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold said the average price increase for major U.S. drug companies in the third quarter was 8.7 percent.

Investors seeking reassurance about the sector&apos;s performance will need to look through some sizeable currency distortions.

U.S. firms will benefit from a recent weakening in the dollar, given their large international exposure, though currency is still negative on a year-on-year basis.

Conversely, European companies -- barring those reporting in dollars -- will start to feel the pinch as their currencies strengthen.

DIVERSIFICATION

Diversified healthcare group Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) opens the reporting season on Oct. 13 with the market wanting to see that its broad-based business model, which means its stock trades at a premium to pure pharmas, is continuing to deliver.

Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), which reports on Oct. 14, should show that at least some blockbusters still have a good future, with arthritis drug Humira proving a key driver.

Switzerland&apos;s Roche (ROG.VX) reports sales figures only on Oct. 15 and Helvea analyst Karl-Heinz Koch expects growth in the pharmaceuticals division to be driven increasingly by new use of cancer drugs including Avastin and Herceptin, underscoring the logic of this year&apos;s buyout of Genentech.

Flu drug Tamiflu, which is being stockpiled by governments to deal with the H1N1 pandemic, will also boost Roche, while demand for swine flu vaccines promises to boost GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

Most swine flu vaccine revenues will only be booked from the fourth quarter, but companies may clarify the profit implications this month, according to analysts.

Pfizer (PFE.N), the world&apos;s biggest drugmaker, will report on Oct. 20 and may offer little cheer. Across-the-board losses in its key products are likely to highlight just why it needs Wyeth WYE.N, the smaller company with a promising pipeline that it agreed to buy for $68 billion in January.

The challenges at Pfizer -- facing loss of patent exclusivity on the world&apos;s biggest selling drug, Lipitor, in 2011 -- mirror those in the wider industry and explain Big Pharma&apos;s fall from favour.

The sector&apos;s relative derating has gathered pace this year as the overall market has rallied, leaving global pharma trading at a 25 percent forward price-to-earnings discount to the wider market.

Investors will probably need several more quarters of results to decide when, if ever, the industry can regain its traditional premium rating.

PARIS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Results of clinical trials held in Europe show that one dose of Sanofi Pasteur&apos;s H1N1 flu vaccine triggers a robust immune response in most participants, the vaccine unit of French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) said.

The mid-stage datas stem from tests of the Panenza and Humenza vaccines on adults and children aged at least three years, after Sanofi began clinical trials in Europe in August.

One dose of Panenza or of the adjuvent or booster-type of vaccine Humenza is deemed protective in at least 93 percent of adults aged 18 to 59 years and in at least 83 percent of adults 60 years and older. In children, the response was 94 percent.

&quot;Humenza and Panenza vaccines are effective answers to different public health needs,&quot; Sanofi Pasteur Chief Executive Wayne Pisano said in a statement on Thursday.

Because of its low dose, Humenza allows for more production capacity, raising the number of doses available and the number of people who can be immunized against what is commonly known as swine flu, he said.

Panenza, given in a standard dose, could be seen by European authorities as a vaccine to protect people who are most vulnerable.

Sanofi shares rose 1.2 percent to 51.16 euros, having gained nearly 2 percent earlier, while the DJ health index .SXDP was little changed. Sanofi shares have risen 12.7 percent so far this year.

&quot;The news is a mild positive for Sanofi-Aventis, but we expect H1N1 vaccine deliveries to be one-off events,&quot; Kepler analyst Tero Weckroth said in a research note. &quot;However, in light of the current data, Sanofi-Aventis is well positioned in the H1N1 season.&quot;

Sanofi-Aventis Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher said the data could slightly speed up the filing of the Panenza, which could be used by pregnant women, for European approval.

&quot;It may accelerate a little the submission of the non-adjuvent,&quot; he told Reuters on the sidelines of a presentation in Paris.

Participants in the trial showed no serious adverse events from the vaccine jabs. Complaints of redness or swelling at the site of injection as well as mild fever, headache and fatigue were reported.

Sanofi has yet to submit its H1N1 vaccine for EU approval. The European Commission on Wednesday cleared Baxter International&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan vaccine against H1N1, following green lights for vaccines made by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

The World Health Organisation earlier this week restated its confidence in the H1N1 flu vaccine, calling it the most important tool against the pandemic after some reports said some people were reluctant to be injected with the new vaccine.

Sanofi late last month began shipments to the United States of its H1N1 vaccine, ahead of schedule. It has a contract to provide 75.3 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S. government.

Separately, Viehbacher told Reuters that sales of its cancer treatment Eloxatin were suffering in the United States from the arrival of generic versions. &quot;They are following the typical generic erosion pattern,&quot; he said. [ID:nN14315488] (Editing by David Holmes amd Lin Noueihed)</body>

Sanofi has yet to submit its H1N1 vaccine for EU approval. The European Commission on Wednesday cleared Baxter International&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan vaccine against H1N1, following green lights for vaccines made by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

The World Health Organisation earlier this week restated its confidence in the H1N1 flu vaccine, calling it the most important tool against the pandemic after some reports said some people were reluctant to be injected with the new vaccine.

Sanofi late last month began shipments to the United States of its H1N1 vaccine, ahead of schedule. It has a contract to provide 75.3 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S. government.

PARIS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Results of clinical trials held in Europe show that one dose of Sanofi Pasteur&apos;s H1N1 flu vaccine triggers a robust immune response in most participants, the vaccine unit of French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) said.

The mid-stage datas stem from tests of the Panenza and Humenza vaccines on adults and children aged at least three years, after Sanofi began clinical trials in Europe in August.

One dose of Panenza or of the adjuvent or booster-type of vaccine Humenza is deemed protective in at least 93 percent of adults aged 18 to 59 years and in at least 83 percent of adults 60 years and older. In children, the response was 94 percent.

&quot;Humenza and Panenza vaccines are effective answers to different public health needs,&quot; Sanofi Pasteur Chief Executive Wayne Pisano said in a statement on Thursday.

Because of its low dose, Humenza allows for more production capacity, raising the number of doses available and the number of people who can be immunized against what is commonly known as swine flu, he said.

Panenza, given in a standard dose, could be seen by European authorities as a vaccine to protect people who are most vulnerable.

Sanofi shares rose 1.2 percent to 51.16 euros, having gained nearly 2 percent earlier, while the DJ health index .SXDP was little changed. Sanofi shares have risen 12.7 percent so far this year.

&quot;The news is a mild positive for Sanofi-Aventis, but we expect H1N1 vaccine deliveries to be one-off events,&quot; Kepler analyst Tero Weckroth said in a research note. &quot;However, in light of the current data, Sanofi-Aventis is well positioned in the H1N1 season.&quot;

Sanofi-Aventis Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher said the data could slightly speed up the filing of the Panenza, which could be used by pregnant women, for European approval.

&quot;It may accelerate a little the submission of the non-adjuvent,&quot; he told Reuters on the sidelines of a presentation in Paris.

Participants in the trial showed no serious adverse events from the vaccine jabs. Complaints of redness or swelling at the site of injection as well as mild fever, headache and fatigue were reported.

Sanofi has yet to submit its H1N1 vaccine for EU approval. The European Commission on Wednesday cleared Baxter International&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan vaccine against H1N1, following green lights for vaccines made by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A study of people who became seriously ill and died with the new pandemic swine flu confirms it is hitting a younger population than the seasonal flu and causes often different symptoms.

The study of 272 patients sick enough to be hospitalized showed about 40 percent had diarrhea and vomiting -- usually rare with seasonal flu -- and confirmed that quick treatment with antivirals could save lives.

Dr. Seema Jain of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the study, said the findings had informed the CDC&apos;s advice on who should worry about the new H1N1 virus and when to get treatment.

&quot;Of the 272 patients we studied, 25 percent were admitted to an intensive care unit and 7 percent died,&quot; Jain&apos;s team wrote in the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

They said 45 percent were children under 18, just 5 percent were over 65 and 73 percent had at least one underlying condition such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease and pregnancy.

The soonest any of the patients who died were treated with an antiviral drug was three days after they started showing symptoms, the researchers found. Patients treated earlier all survived.

Roche AG&apos;s (ROG.VX) Tamiflu or GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s (GSK.L) Relenza should be given within 48 hours of symptoms to be the most effective. But Jain said it was never too late to try.

&quot;We really believe that antivirals should be started as soon as possible in patients who are hospitalized,&quot; Jain said in a telephone interview.

Even if patients do not have the traditional risk factors for serious disease, they should get antiviral drugs if they are sick enough to be hospitalized, Jain said.

FEVER AND COUGH

The cases her team examined represented about a quarter of the hospitalized H1N1 patients in the United States between May 1 and June 9 of this year, before the epidemic was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

All the patients had fever and cough, 42 percent of the children had diarrhea or vomiting, and all of the patients 65 and older had an underlying condition. Some studies suggest people born before 1952 have some immunity to the H1N1 virus.

Of those whose height and weight were available, 29 percent were obese and 26 percent were morbidly obese. Jain said the percentage of people who were obese reflected the general U.S. population, but only 5 percent of the population is morbidly obese.

Some other studies have suggested that morbid obesity -- defined as having a body mass index or BMI of 40 or higher -- may raise a person&apos;s risk of serious complications and death from H1N1. Jain said that question needed more study.

The study found that 7 percent of the hospitalized patients died, and all of those who died had been on ventilators. Those who died ranged in age from 1 year to 57 years.

Those who died were more likely to have been short of breath, to have pneumonia, a neurological disorder or acute respiratory distress syndrome. They were also less likely to have received a seasonal flu vaccine over the past year.

In its weekly report on death and disease, another CDC team found that 41 percent of children aged 6 months to 2 years got a seasonal flu vaccine last year, 32 percent of 2- to 4-year-olds, 20 percent of other children aged up to 17, 32 percent of young adults, 42 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds and 67 percent of those over 65 -- who have the highest risk of severe illness or death from seasonal flu.

    <body>By Eric Lai - Computerworld

If the H1N1, or swine, flu hits hard this fall and winter, emergency rooms will be on the front lines.

By using business intelligence-style analytic application, ERs may also be a key in efforts to determine how widely the disease is spreading in its early stages, which could help quash it before it grows out of control.

That&apos;s what Livingston, N. J.-based Emergency Medical Associates is expecting from its analytics system .

The firm operates 21 emergency rooms in hospitals in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, where its medical staff will treat more than 1 million patients this year. The crush of EMA ER patients from multiple locations provides a gold mine of data for spotting pandemics before they start raging, according to Jonathan Rothman, EMA director of data management.

EMA uses SAP AG&apos;s BusinessObjects XI tool set as its main BI platform, Xcelsius as its point-and-click data visualization tool, Crystal Reports for building the reports, and SAP&apos;s BusinessObjects Web Intelligence software to create self-service reports and dashboards. The software runs on top of an Oracle database.

In total, EMA physicians and nurses use 27 real-time dashboards and get 30 daily reports.

Generally, about 6% of patients that come into an EMA emergency room on any given day complain of fever and other flu-like symptoms, says Dr. Michael Gerardi, regional vice president for EMA.

By using the BI tools to compare recent activity with historical outbreaks of regular flu, EMA was the first medical provider to detect H1N1&apos;s arrival in New Jersey and New York during last spring&apos;s outbreak.

&quot;The percentage of visitors complaining of flu-like symptoms spiked up to between 25-30% in some of our emergency rooms,&quot; Gerardi said.

Those upsurges of patients, along with their reported symptoms, were significant enough that EMA was able to determine with confidence that this was no &quot;run-of-the-mill spring flu&quot; nor an epidemic of &quot;the worried well,&quot; Gerardi said.

Whether it&apos;s perceived flu or real flu doesn&apos;t necessarily matter to EMA, which must still deal with sudden influxes of patients either way, Gerardi said. The BI tools allow EMA to be much more agile, and re-assign nurses and doctors to hospitals that they predict will be slammed hard with new patients -- H1N1 sufferers and otherwise.

    <body>BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has recorded its first known death from the H1N1 swine flu virus, a hospital in the western city of Essen said Thursday.

Researchers said post-mortem tests on a 36-year-old woman who died on September 25 confirmed the virus as the cause.

A hospital spokesman and the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said the death was the country&apos;s first from H1N1.

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Vaccination programs against H1N1 swine flu are under way in the United States, China and Australia and will begin soon in parts of Europe.

As people await their chance for immunization, below are some questions and answers about flu symptoms and what to do if they arrive before the vaccine does.

There are also online self-assessments to help determine whether someone has the flu, including www.flu.gov/evaluation/ from the U.S. government and h1n1.cloudapp.net/Default.aspx from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

WHAT IS INFLUENZA AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF H1N1 SWINE FLU?

Influenza is a virus that infects the nose, throat and lungs. Seasonal flu typically kills 250,000 to 500,000 people globally, mostly the elderly, but also very young children, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases.

H1N1 swine flu is a new strain that appeared in March and became pandemic in June. Like seasonal flu, H1N1 is usually mild and requires no medical care. But H1N1 also differs from seasonal flu because it is more likely to infect children and young people than the elderly.

Most H1N1 symptoms are the same as seasonal flu: fever, coughing or sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, body aches, chills and fatigue. But swine flu also can cause vomiting and diarrhea.

Dozens of other viruses cause similar symptoms, but one hallmark of influenza is a sudden onset of symptoms. An illness that develops gradually is likely to be from another virus.

WHAT IF SOMEONE GETS SICK?

People who are infected with the H1N1 virus may be contagious as early as one day before they show symptoms.

Because H1N1 is the overwhelming flu strain circulating globally, health authorities say anyone with influenza should assume it is the swine flu.

Quick flu tests may not detect H1N1, so doctors are advised not to bother testing people with flu-like symptoms.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people with H1N1 stay home from work, school, travel, shopping, social events and public gatherings until at least 24 hours after the fever has disappeared.

Officials also urge the sick to avoid contact with anyone in a high-risk group, including pregnant women, children and infants, and people with chronic medical conditions including asthma, diabetes or heart disease.

In the meantime, officials recommend frequent hand-washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and in some cases use of face masks to avoid spreading infection.

The main remedies for mild illness are rest and ample fluids such as water, broth, sports drinks or electrolyte beverages made to prevent dehydration in small children.

WHAT IF SOMEONE GETS REALLY SICK?

Medical attention is recommended if the sick person has difficulty breathing or chest pain, appears blue or purple around the lips, vomits and cannot keep liquids down or shows signs of dehydration including dizziness.

The government recommends that people with chronic conditions who come into contact with an H1N1 patient seek treatment with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, which Roche AG (ROG.VX) and Gilead Science (GILD.O) sell under the Tamiflu brand name, or zanamivir, an inhaled medicine produced as Relenza by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L),

Pregnant women are urged to take special care, as they are always at heightened risk from flu and especially H1N1. More than 100 pregnant women have been admitted to intensive care with H1N1 in the United States this year and 28 have died.

Parents should especially seek treatment for children with flu-like symptoms who cannot be awakened easily, who appear blue or gray, or who become ill again after getting better -- as this last symptom may indicate they have a secondary bacterial infection that can be more serious after a bout of flu.

Parents should especially seek treatment for children with flu-like symptoms who cannot be awakened easily, who appear blue or gray, or who become ill again after getting better -- as this last symptom may indicate they have a secondary bacterial infection that can be more serious after a bout of flu.

    <body>HONG KONG, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Health experts in Asia have urged people against underestimating an expected second wave of infections from the pandemic H1N1 swine flu, even though the virus appears to have been mild for most people so far.

The second wave is expected to occur during the winter months in temperate countries in the northern hemisphere and around the end of the year for tropical countries.

&quot;Flu is not a trivial disease, it is not always mild, children can die. When that happens, people get agitated but that is no surprise, flu can turn severe and people get hospitalised,&quot; said microbiologist Malik Peiris at the University of Hong Kong.

&quot;People who are at risk are those with underlying chronic disease, pregnant ... we must explain this to the public, that if you are in these high risk groups, it is important to be protected (vaccinated) from the virus,&quot; Peiris said.

Here&apos;s what the region is doing about H1N1 vaccination:

AUSTRALIA

Australia rolled out a nationwide vaccination drive for H1N1 influenza in late September. Some 5.5 million doses of vaccine have been delivered across the country, enough for 30 percent of the population, and two million doses each month will be made available until January.

The campaign is Australia&apos;s biggest mass vaccination and is estimated to cost over A$100 million ($87.95 million). Australia ordered 21 million doses of the flu vaccine from pharmaceutical company CSL Ltd (CSL.AX).

Vaccinations will start with those most at risk, including health care workers, pregnant women and the chronically ill.

CHINA

China began a mass vaccination programme on September 21, starting with 100,000 students in Beijing.

Its plan is to cover public service providers and vulnerable groups, such as healthcare workers and pregnant women, in densely populated cities and travel hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta.

The government placed orders with local vaccine makers Hualan Biological Engineering Inc. (002007.SZ) and Sinovac Biotech Ltd SVA.A and expects 65 million doses to be delivered by year-end -- meaning more than 60 million people would be covered.

HONG KONG

The government has issued a tender to buy three million doses but no decision has been made. Hong Kong&apos;s health minister expects the second wave of the pandemic to arrive in January or February, the city&apos;s next seasonal flu peak.

However, it is not too worried about vaccine supply because China has pledged to supply Hong Kong with Chinese vaccines in case needed, even though China wouldn&apos;t even have enough for its own citizens.

Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, set aside HK$700 million ($89.7 million) to purchase the vaccines.

Two million doses would be reserved for people in four high-risk groups: health workers, children between 6 months and 6 years of age, people over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions, such as obesity, respiratory illnesses and diabetes. An additional one million doses would be reserved for those who want to pay for them themselves.

INDIA

The Indian government has given three companies approval to produce a H1N1 vaccine, said V.M. Katoch, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research. They are Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Panacea Biotech (PNCA.BO).

The vaccines are being tested on animals and will be tested on humans by the end of 2009. The companies aim to put the vaccine on the market by April 2010, Katoch said.

The federal government wants to test vaccines imported from abroad from four pharmaceutical companies by November.

Katoch did not give a figure on how much the government has spent on vaccines or how many doses would be produced. He said India&apos;s four million medical staff and security forces would get priority. India has stockpiled 40 million to 50 million doses of Tamiflu.

JAPAN

Japan will buy $1.26 billion worth of vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) (GSK) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) for 50 million people. It will also secure doses from four local vaccine makers for another 27 million citizens.

It hopes to get 77 million people, 60 percent of its population, vaccinated by end March.

Mass immunisation will begin on Oct. 19 with medical staff who treat flu patients, in November with pregnant women and people with underlying chronic illnesses, and in December with small children.

Parents of babies under a year old, students in junior and high school and above 4th grade in elementary school, and the elderly will be vaccinated from January.

Japanese are generally keen to get vaccinated but worry about possible side effects.

SINGAPORE

The government has secured one million doses from GSK and delivery is expected by end 2009. However, large scale vaccination will only begin after the government is &quot;satisfied with the safety and efficacy reviews of this vaccine&quot;, according to the country&apos;s Ministry of Health.

About 20 percent of the vaccine will be reserved for essential workers and the rest go to the public on a voluntary basis.

The vaccines will be made available to family doctors at cost price. The cost of the H1N1 vaccine is comparable to the cost of seasonal influenza vaccines, the ministry added.

The ministry also has a deal with Australia&apos;s CSL to supply more vaccines when they are ready and when necessary.

SOUTH KOREA

Mass vaccination of about 13.7 million people, or 27 percent of the population, is expected to begin in mid-November. It will cover all medical staff, pregnant women, students and soldiers and is expected to end in February 2010.

Local vaccine maker Green Cross (006280.KS) will supply 12 million doses in total -- seven million within the year and five million in February. Green Cross has agreed to provide 1.1 million doses for 9.1 billion won ($7.8 million).

The country is also buying three million doses from GSK and negotiations are underway to buy the doses at 14,000 won each.

There were concerns earlier that the government might be charging more than the original cost for the vaccines, but the ministry has since explained that the local supplier set initial prices much higher than planned.

THAILAND

Thailand hopes to take delivery of the first batch of vaccines by year-end. They would be for one percent of its population: healthcare workers, pregnant women, people with respiratory illnesses and other high risk groups.

It is negotiating with two or three companies, which will provide the vaccine at about 5 euros (($7.39) per dose.

Witit Akaravejakun, managing director of the Thai government&apos;s pharmaceutical organisation, said the delay was due to negotiations on costs, number of doses required for each person and concerns about side effects.

It is also waiting for results of domestic trials.

&quot;We want to wait for the result of our research. If we can produce our own vaccine domestically, it will save us a lot of our budget,&quot; Akaravejakun said.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A study of people who became seriously ill and died with the new pandemic swine flu confirms it is hitting a younger population than the seasonal flu and causes often different symptoms.

The study of 272 patients sick enough to be hospitalized showed about 40 percent had diarrhea and vomiting -- usually rare with seasonal flu -- and confirmed that quick treatment with antivirals could save lives.

Dr. Seema Jain of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the study, said the findings had informed the CDC&apos;s advice on who should worry about the new H1N1 virus and when to get treatment.

&quot;Of the 272 patients we studied, 25 percent were admitted to an intensive care unit and 7 percent died,&quot; Jain&apos;s team wrote in the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

They said 45 percent were children under 18, just 5 percent were over 65 and 73 percent had at least one underlying condition such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease and pregnancy.

The soonest any of the patients who died were treated with an antiviral drug was three days after they started showing symptoms, the researchers found. Patients treated earlier all survived.

Roche AG&apos;s Tamiflu or GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s Relenza should be given within 48 hours of symptoms to be the most effective. But Jain said it was never too late to try.

&quot;We really believe that antivirals should be started as soon as possible in patients who are hospitalized,&quot; Jain said in a telephone interview.

Even if patients do not have the traditional risk factors for serious disease, they should get antiviral drugs if they are sick enough to be hospitalized, Jain said.

FEVER AND COUGH

The cases her team examined represented about a quarter of the hospitalized H1N1 patients in the United States between May 1 and June 9 of this year, before the epidemic was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

All the patients had fever and cough, 42 percent of the children had diarrhea or vomiting, and all of the patients 65 and older had an underlying condition. Some studies suggest people born before 1952 have some immunity to the H1N1 virus.

Of those whose height and weight were available, 29 percent were obese and 26 percent were morbidly obese. Jain said the percentage of people who were obese reflected the general U.S. population, but only 5 percent of the population is morbidly obese.

Some other studies have suggested that morbid obesity -- defined as having a body mass index or BMI of 40 or higher -- may raise a person&apos;s risk of serious complications and death from H1N1. Jain said that question needed more study.

The study found that 7 percent of the hospitalized patients died, and all of those who died had been on ventilators. Those who died ranged in age from 1 year to 57 years.

Those who died were more likely to have been short of breath, to have pneumonia, a neurological disorder or acute respiratory distress syndrome. They were also less likely to have received a seasonal flu vaccine over the past year.

In its weekly report on death and disease, another CDC team found that 41 percent of children aged 6 months to 2 years got a seasonal flu vaccine last year, 32 percent of 2- to 4-year-olds, 20 percent of other children aged up to 17, 32 percent of young adults, 42 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds and 67 percent of those over 65 -- who have the highest risk of severe illness or death from seasonal flu.

    <body>By Eric Lai - Computerworld

If the H1N1, or swine, flu hits hard this fall and winter, emergency rooms will be on the front lines.

By using business intelligence-style analytic application, ERs may also be a key in efforts to determine how widely the disease is spreading in its early stages, which could help quash it before it grows out of control.

That&apos;s what Livingston, N. J.-based Emergency Medical Associates is expecting from its analytics system .

The firm operates 21 emergency rooms in hospitals in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, where its medical staff will treat more than 1 million patients this year. The crush of EMA ER patients from multiple locations provides a gold mine of data for spotting pandemics before they start raging, according to Jonathan Rothman, EMA director of data management.

EMA uses SAP AG&apos;s BusinessObjects XI tool set as its main BI platform, Xcelsius as its point-and-click data visualization tool, Crystal Reports for building the reports, and SAP&apos;s BusinessObjects Web Intelligence software to create self-service reports and dashboards. The software runs on top of an Oracle database.

In total, EMA physicians and nurses use 27 real-time dashboards and get 30 daily reports.

Generally, about 6% of patients that come into an EMA emergency room on any given day complain of fever and other flu-like symptoms, says Dr. Michael Gerardi, regional vice president for EMA.

By using the BI tools to compare recent activity with historical outbreaks of regular flu, EMA was the first medical provider to detect H1N1&apos;s arrival in New Jersey and New York during last spring&apos;s outbreak.

&quot;The percentage of visitors complaining of flu-like symptoms spiked up to between 25-30% in some of our emergency rooms,&quot; Gerardi said.

Those upsurges of patients, along with their reported symptoms, were significant enough that EMA was able to determine with confidence that this was no &quot;run-of-the-mill spring flu&quot; nor an epidemic of &quot;the worried well,&quot; Gerardi said.

Whether it&apos;s perceived flu or real flu doesn&apos;t necessarily matter to EMA, which must still deal with sudden influxes of patients either way, Gerardi said. The BI tools allow EMA to be much more agile, and re-assign nurses and doctors to hospitals that they predict will be slammed hard with new patients -- H1N1 sufferers and otherwise.

    <body>BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has recorded its first known death from the H1N1 swine flu virus, a hospital in the western city of Essen said Thursday.

Researchers said post-mortem tests on a 36-year-old woman who died on September 25 confirmed the virus as the cause.

A hospital spokesman and the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said the death was the country&apos;s first from H1N1.

By David Morgan

WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Vaccination programs against H1N1 swine flu are under way in the United States, China and Australia and will begin soon in parts of Europe.

As people await their chance for immunization, below are some questions and answers about flu symptoms and what to do if they arrive before the vaccine does.

There are also online self-assessments to help determine whether someone has the flu, including www.flu.gov/evaluation/ from the U.S. government and h1n1.cloudapp.net/Default.aspx from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

WHAT IS INFLUENZA AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF H1N1 SWINE FLU?

Influenza is a virus that infects the nose, throat and lungs. Seasonal flu typically kills 250,000 to 500,000 people globally, mostly the elderly, but also very young children, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases.

H1N1 swine flu is a new strain that appeared in March and became pandemic in June. Like seasonal flu, H1N1 is usually mild and requires no medical care. But H1N1 also differs from seasonal flu because it is more likely to infect children and young people than the elderly.

Most H1N1 symptoms are the same as seasonal flu: fever, coughing or sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, body aches, chills and fatigue. But swine flu also can cause vomiting and diarrhea.

Dozens of other viruses cause similar symptoms, but one hallmark of influenza is a sudden onset of symptoms. An illness that develops gradually is likely to be from another virus.

WHAT IF SOMEONE GETS SICK?

People who are infected with the H1N1 virus may be contagious as early as one day before they show symptoms.

Because H1N1 is the overwhelming flu strain circulating globally, health authorities say anyone with influenza should assume it is the swine flu.

Quick flu tests may not detect H1N1, so doctors are advised not to bother testing people with flu-like symptoms.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people with H1N1 stay home from work, school, travel, shopping, social events and public gatherings until at least 24 hours after the fever has disappeared.

Officials also urge the sick to avoid contact with anyone in a high-risk group, including pregnant women, children and infants, and people with chronic medical conditions including asthma, diabetes or heart disease.

In the meantime, officials recommend frequent hand-washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and in some cases use of face masks to avoid spreading infection.

The main remedies for mild illness are rest and ample fluids such as water, broth, sports drinks or electrolyte beverages made to prevent dehydration in small children.

WHAT IF SOMEONE GETS REALLY SICK?

Medical attention is recommended if the sick person has difficulty breathing or chest pain, appears blue or purple around the lips, vomits and cannot keep liquids down or shows signs of dehydration including dizziness.

The government recommends that people with chronic conditions who come into contact with an H1N1 patient seek treatment with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, which Roche AG (ROG.VX) and Gilead Science (GILD.O) sell under the Tamiflu brand name, or zanamivir, an inhaled medicine produced as Relenza by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L),

Pregnant women are urged to take special care, as they are always at heightened risk from flu and especially H1N1. More than 100 pregnant women have been admitted to intensive care with H1N1 in the United States this year and 28 have died.

Parents should especially seek treatment for children with flu-like symptoms who cannot be awakened easily, who appear blue or gray, or who become ill again after getting better -- as this last symptom may indicate they have a secondary bacterial infection that can be more serious after a bout of flu.

    <body>HONG KONG, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Health experts in Asia have urged people against underestimating an expected second wave of infections from the pandemic H1N1 swine flu, even though the virus appears to have been mild for most people so far.

The second wave is expected to occur during the winter months in temperate countries in the northern hemisphere and around the end of the year for tropical countries.

&quot;Flu is not a trivial disease, it is not always mild, children can die. When that happens, people get agitated but that is no surprise, flu can turn severe and people get hospitalised,&quot; said microbiologist Malik Peiris at the University of Hong Kong.

&quot;People who are at risk are those with underlying chronic disease, pregnant ... we must explain this to the public, that if you are in these high risk groups, it is important to be protected (vaccinated) from the virus,&quot; Peiris said.

Here&apos;s what the region is doing about H1N1 vaccination:

AUSTRALIA

Australia rolled out a nationwide vaccination drive for H1N1 influenza in late September. Some 5.5 million doses of vaccine have been delivered across the country, enough for 30 percent of the population, and two million doses each month will be made available until January.

The campaign is Australia&apos;s biggest mass vaccination and is estimated to cost over A$100 million ($87.95 million). Australia ordered 21 million doses of the flu vaccine from pharmaceutical company CSL Ltd (CSL.AX).

Vaccinations will start with those most at risk, including health care workers, pregnant women and the chronically ill.

CHINA

China began a mass vaccination programme on September 21, starting with 100,000 students in Beijing.

Its plan is to cover public service providers and vulnerable groups, such as healthcare workers and pregnant women, in densely populated cities and travel hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta.

The government placed orders with local vaccine makers Hualan Biological Engineering Inc. (002007.SZ) and Sinovac Biotech Ltd SVA.A and expects 65 million doses to be delivered by year-end -- meaning more than 60 million people would be covered.

HONG KONG

The government has issued a tender to buy three million doses but no decision has been made. Hong Kong&apos;s health minister expects the second wave of the pandemic to arrive in January or February, the city&apos;s next seasonal flu peak.

However, it is not too worried about vaccine supply because China has pledged to supply Hong Kong with Chinese vaccines in case needed, even though China wouldn&apos;t even have enough for its own citizens.

Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, set aside HK$700 million ($89.7 million) to purchase the vaccines.

Two million doses would be reserved for people in four high-risk groups: health workers, children between 6 months and 6 years of age, people over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions, such as obesity, respiratory illnesses and diabetes. An additional one million doses would be reserved for those who want to pay for them themselves.

INDIA

The Indian government has given three companies approval to produce a H1N1 vaccine, said V.M. Katoch, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research. They are Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Panacea Biotech (PNCA.BO).

The vaccines are being tested on animals and will be tested on humans by the end of 2009. The companies aim to put the vaccine on the market by April 2010, Katoch said.

The federal government wants to test vaccines imported from abroad from four pharmaceutical companies by November.

Katoch did not give a figure on how much the government has spent on vaccines or how many doses would be produced. He said India&apos;s four million medical staff and security forces would get priority. India has stockpiled 40 million to 50 million doses of Tamiflu.

JAPAN

Japan will buy $1.26 billion worth of vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) (GSK) and Novartis (NOVN.VX) for 50 million people. It will also secure doses from four local vaccine makers for another 27 million citizens.

It hopes to get 77 million people, 60 percent of its population, vaccinated by end March.

Mass immunisation will begin on Oct. 19 with medical staff who treat flu patients, in November with pregnant women and people with underlying chronic illnesses, and in December with small children.

Parents of babies under a year old, students in junior and high school and above 4th grade in elementary school, and the elderly will be vaccinated from January.

Japanese are generally keen to get vaccinated but worry about possible side effects.

SINGAPORE

The government has secured one million doses from GSK and delivery is expected by end 2009. However, large scale vaccination will only begin after the government is &quot;satisfied with the safety and efficacy reviews of this vaccine&quot;, according to the country&apos;s Ministry of Health.

About 20 percent of the vaccine will be reserved for essential workers and the rest go to the public on a voluntary basis.

The vaccines will be made available to family doctors at cost price. The cost of the H1N1 vaccine is comparable to the cost of seasonal influenza vaccines, the ministry added.

The ministry also has a deal with Australia&apos;s CSL to supply more vaccines when they are ready and when necessary.

SOUTH KOREA

Mass vaccination of about 13.7 million people, or 27 percent of the population, is expected to begin in mid-November. It will cover all medical staff, pregnant women, students and soldiers and is expected to end in February 2010.

Local vaccine maker Green Cross (006280.KS) will supply 12 million doses in total -- seven million within the year and five million in February. Green Cross has agreed to provide 1.1 million doses for 9.1 billion won ($7.8 million).

The country is also buying three million doses from GSK and negotiations are underway to buy the doses at 14,000 won each.

There were concerns earlier that the government might be charging more than the original cost for the vaccines, but the ministry has since explained that the local supplier set initial prices much higher than planned.

THAILAND

Thailand hopes to take delivery of the first batch of vaccines by year-end. They would be for one percent of its population: healthcare workers, pregnant women, people with respiratory illnesses and other high risk groups.

It is negotiating with two or three companies, which will provide the vaccine at about 5 euros (($7.39) per dose.

Witit Akaravejakun, managing director of the Thai government&apos;s pharmaceutical organisation, said the delay was due to negotiations on costs, number of doses required for each person and concerns about side effects.

It is also waiting for results of domestic trials.

&quot;We want to wait for the result of our research. If we can produce our own vaccine domestically, it will save us a lot of our budget,&quot; Akaravejakun said.

    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Wednesday sought to dispel fears about the H1N1 swine flu vaccine, declaring it safe and urging parents to take precautions against the pandemic.

&quot;This H1N1 vaccine is being made exactly the way seasonal flu vaccine has been made year in and year out,&quot; Sebelius said on NBC&apos;s &quot;Today&quot; show.

&quot;The adverse effects are minimal compared to what can happen when you get the flu,&quot; she said.

Sebelius was seeking to ease worries about the vaccine to target the new strain of influenza that is spreading around the world and she urged the public to visit flu.gov for more information.

&quot;This definitely is a safe vaccine for people to get,&quot; she said.

Sebelius said it was important to protect the more vulnerable population such as children and pregnant women from the H1N1 flu.

&quot;This flu is a younger person&apos;s flu, kids have no immunity to this flu,&quot; she said.

Children also easily spread viruses to those around them, putting others at risk such as grandparents and baby-sitters, Sebelius said.

&quot;We strongly urge parents to take precautionary steps, the flu kills every year, people get seriously ill, and we&apos;ve got a great vaccine to deal with it,&quot; she said.

Sebelius also said she was &quot;really stunned&quot; that only about 40 percent of U.S. healthcare workers get seasonal flu vaccines. &quot;I&apos;m hopeful that healthcare workers not only take the seasonal but get at the front of the line for H1N1,&quot; she said on CNN.

    <body>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will start a mass vaccination program against the deadly H1N1 swine flu before the end of the month and hospital patients will be first to get the shot, the country&apos;s chief medical officer said on Thursday.

Swine flu deaths so far stand at 76 in England, 10 in Scotland, three in Northern Ireland and one in Wales.

There were an estimated 18,000 new cases of H1N1 flu in the past week, up from around 14,000 in the previous weeks, according to health officials.

Liam Donaldson said the government had around half a million doses of Baxter International&apos;s vaccine in warehouses ready for use, while delivery of the first of millions of doses of a vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline was &quot;imminent.&quot;

The first people to be immunized will be patients in hospital who are suffering serious illnesses that make them more vulnerable to the disease.

Hospital staff who have daily contact with seriously ill people will also be at the front of the line to get the shot.

Donaldson said Britain was &quot;well into the second wave&quot; of swine flu, which was &quot;proving so far to be a slow burn.&quot;

He said there was a possibility that the virus might peak at a lower level previously feared, which would be &quot;incredibly positive news.&quot;

&quot;Any breathing space we get ... we will take because it gives us the opportunity to fight this disease and save lives,&quot; he said.

The World Health Organization earlier this week restated its confidence in vaccination, saying it was the most important tool against the pandemic after some reports said some people were reluctant to be injected with the new vaccines.

The European Commission gave a license for Baxter&apos;s Celvapan vaccine against H1N1 on Wednesday, following earlier green lights for Pandemrix and Focetria vaccines made by GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.

    <body>CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government awarded $60 million to researchers and companies on Thursday to develop vaccine adjuvants -- substances designed to boost the immune response and can help stretch short vaccine supplies.

&quot;The goal of these awards is to find safe new adjuvants that will boost the effectiveness of vaccines,&quot; Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, which awarded the grants.

&quot;Adjuvants can be used not only to enhance the immune response to a vaccine and thereby offer better protection but also to extend the vaccine supply if needed, enabling more people to be vaccinated with fewer doses,&quot; Fauci said in a statement.

The five-year contracts went to six researchers, including one from Corixa Corp. of Hamilton, Montana, a unit of Britain-based drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.

Other awards went to researchers at the University of Michigan, the University of California San Diego, the University of Kansas, the University of Washington School of Medicine, and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York.

Currently, the only vaccine adjuvant approved for use in the United States is an aluminum mixture known as alum, which is not used in flu vaccines because it does a poor job at boosting the immune response.

Adjuvants are widely used in flu vaccines in Europe, including vaccines made by Glaxo and Novartis.

The World Health Organization promotes the use of adjuvants because they can stretch the short supply of vaccine for H1N1 swine flu vaccine, making more shots available to needy countries.

WHO says the global capacity to make influenza vaccines is about 3 billion doses a year -- not enough to cover the population of 6.8 billion people.

NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The European Commission has approved Baxter International Inc&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan vaccine against H1N1 flu, the company said on Wednesday.

The positive ruling was expected after the European Medicines Agency recommended the vaccine last week. European regulators earlier gave a green light to the first H1N1 swine flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

Governments have been scrambling for vaccines to target the new H1N1 flu strain, ahead of a feared second wave of infection.

Baxter said initial quantities of its vaccine have already been delivered to a number of countries, including Britain and Ireland, for use in their national vaccination programs. (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Derek Caney)</body>

    <body>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - Canadian health officials on Wednesday defended the pace of their H1N1 vaccination program, saying it was more ambitious than a U.S. initiative even though it was starting later.

Canada does not expect to begin vaccinating people until early November once testing and regulatory approval is completed, but says the plan is to make sure it is available for everyone who wants it.

&quot;This is the largest immunization plan in history, we have to get it right,&quot; said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief medical health officer said at a news conference.

Clusters of outbreaks have cropped up in Canada, but the virus appears to be spreading more slowly than in the United States where some vaccinations have begun, Butler-Jones said.

The U.S. vaccine differs from the one Canada is preparing to use in that it contains small amounts of live virus, making it unsuitable for inoculating the elderly and young children, who have the highest risk of getting the disease, Butler-Jones said.

&quot;The fact that they have access to the vaccine is nice. ... That&apos;s a useful thing, but in small amounts and for a small number of people and not those at greatest risk of serious disease, Butler-Jones.

Officials acknowledged that Canadian production of the H1N1 vaccine started behind other countries, but said it was because the supplier needed to complete work on the vaccine being used on this year&apos;s seasonable flu.

Europe was able to start its clinical trials on its vaccine before Canada because it had supplies available sooner, but the data from those tests will also be considered by Canada as it gives its vaccine final approval.

    <body>By Jessica Hall and Phil Wahba

PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Hype about the swine flu vaccines, pent-up demand for cash and a push by major drugmakers to boost their flagging research pipelines has helped lift biotechnology fund-raising 36 percent so far this year.

Biotech firms have raised $5.7 billion through an assortment of 39 debt and share offerings, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Follow-on offerings have been the most prevalent form of fund-raising, with 29 such transactions, the data showed. (here)

Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) led the fund-raising with debt offerings that generated proceeds of $1.99 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

&quot;It&apos;s an opportunistic time to raise money -- there&apos;s a lot of attention on vaccines, cancer and emerging drugs to fill drug pipelines,&quot; said one healthcare investment banker who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch led the league tables in terms of biotech fund-raising activity. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) followed as No. 3 in terms of bookrunning, the data showed.

Some of the activity was driven by pent-up demand after weakness in financial markets made it difficult to raise money last year, and eroded many biotech&apos;s cash cushion.

&quot;Last year a combination of depressed valuations, limited investor appetite for risk and illiquid trading profiles created a scenario where many biotech companies were within one years worth of cash remaining,&quot; said Jim Cooney, managing director of Equity Capital Markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

&quot;Traditionally a biotech company would access the equity markets well in advance of eighteen months of cash remaining. When market sentiment improved and investors appetite for risk increased, a scenario was created for these companies to issue equity in an accelerated manner,&quot; Cooney said.

The wave of follow-ons in the sector comes at a time biotech stocks have surged. The Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI is up 33.9 percent since March lows.

&quot;If market performance continues the way we expect it to, with the demand we&apos;ve seen, the activity we&apos;ll see in the next 18-24 months will make this wave we&apos;ve had seem de minimis in nature,&quot; Cooney said.

Some capital raising came in the wake of excitement over H1N1 (swine flu) vaccines as several small companies used positive data trials as springboards for share offerings.

&quot;One strong study can set the stage for a new round of fund-raising or venture capital money,&quot; the investment banker said.

For example, Vical Inc (VICL.O) announced on May 21 that it had advanced the development of its H1N1 vaccine. The next day, Vical said it would sell shares worth $15.4 million. Four days after that, it said it would sell shares and options worth an additional $4.6 million.

Inovio BioMedical (INO.A) in July also followed on the success of its H1N1 vaccine in animal studies with news it would sell shares and warrants worth $30 million.

IPOs SHOW MIXED RESULTS

Biotech and pharma IPOs have been less prevalent and have had mixed results.

Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc, which broke a nearly two-year drought for IPOs in the drug sector, raised $85 mln in August, but its stock has dropped 9.1 percent since its debut.

Meanwhile, shares of Talecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp (TLCR.O) gained 11.3 percent in their first day of trading last week -- marking the largest biopharmaceuticals IPO in three years.

Unlike most IPOs in the sector, Talecris already has products on the market in addition to those in development, allowing it to attract more interest, analysts said.

Its products are used to treat a number of diseases, including immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders, infections and severe trauma.

&quot;The IPOs by Talecris and Cumberland Pharmaceuticals were able to come because both companies have approved products and have stable revenues -- investors might not quite be ready yet for more speculative biopharma IPOs,&quot; said Bill Buhr, IPO Strategist with Morningstar Inc&apos;s IPO Service.

Investors will gravitate towards the defensive healthcare industry and that will contribute to interest in a certain type of pharma IPO, according to Buhr.

BIOTECH M&amp;A SLUMPS

Overall mergers and acquisitions in the biotech sector have fallen amid the general slump in dealmaking. Worldwide M&amp;A for biotech has fallen 84.6 percent this year to $8.4 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters. U.S. merger activity in the sector is down 90.6 percent, data showed.

Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Citigroup lead the list of advisers for biotech M&amp;A, according to Thomson Reuters.

The largest biotech deal of the year was Bristol-Myers Squibb Co&apos;s (BMY.N) acquisition of antibody technology specialist Medarex for $2.4 billion, which marked a 90 percent premium, according to Thomson Reuters. (here)

Investors have bid up shares of similar companies such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) and Seattle Genetics Inc (SGEN.O) in the wake of the rich Medarex deal in hopes other mergers will surface.

The next-largest deals in biotech were Johnson &amp; Johnson&apos;s (JNJ.N) purchase of cancer drug developer Cougar Biotechnology Inc for $970 million and its $885 million purchase of an 18.4 percent stake in Irish drugmaker Elan Corp Plc.

&quot;Big pharma has been behind the curve in building their biopharma capabilities and have been making acquisitions. But there&apos;s still very limited appetite for very early stage companies,&quot; said a second health care investment banker who declined to be named.

    <body>* Only 13 percent of vaccinated patients got swine flu

* None of the vaccinated patients died of H1N1 swine flu

WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Mexican researchers say they have some evidence that the ordinary seasonal flu vaccine may offer some protection against the new pandemic H1N1 swine flu -- contrary to other studies.

They found that people who had been vaccinated against seasonal flu were far less likely to be sick or to die from H1N1 than people who had not been immunized against seasonal flu.

&quot;These results are to be considered cautiously and in no way indicate that seasonal vaccine should replace vaccination against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009,&quot; Lourdes Garcia-Garcia and colleagues at the National Institute of Public Health in Cuernavaca wrote in the British Medical Journal.

But they said the findings might offer some good news for people who have been vaccinated against seasonal flu, especially as governments are just beginning to distribute newly made swine flu vaccines.

The new H1N1 swine flu virus is a very distant cousin of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus, which is included in the mixture provided every year in the seasonal flu vaccine.

Most studies have shown the annual vaccine provides little or no protection against H1N1, likely because it is very different.

One study in Canada suggested that in fact people who got seasonal flu vaccines may be more likely to become infected with H1N1, although the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both expressed doubts about the findings.

Garcia&apos;s team studied 60 patients with confirmed swine flu and 180 similar people with other diseases being treated in the Mexico City area.

The Mexican government distributes seasonal flu vaccine.

Only eight people who had been vaccinated against seasonal flu were among the swine flu cases, the researchers reported. They found that 29 percent of unvaccinated people in the study became infected with H1N1, versus 13 percent of vaccinated people.

None of the vaccinated people died, but 35 percent of swine flu patients who died had not been vaccinated against seasonal flu, they found.

&quot;Seasonal vaccination might protect against the most severe forms of the disease,&quot; the researchers wrote.

Menno de Jong of the University of Amsterdam and Rogier Sanders of Cornell University in New York said the study shows some protection but said what the world really needs is a universal flu vaccine that protects people against all strains.

Currently, the seasonal vaccine must be formulated every year because influenza viruses mutate, and new strains, such as the H1N1 swine flu, require a completely new vaccine. The new H1N1 vaccine took five months to formulate and manufacture. (Reporting by Maggie Fox; Editing by Eric Walsh)</body>

    <body>By Yoko Nishikawa

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government said on Tuesday it would buy enough H1N1 flu vaccine from British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline and Switzerland&apos;s Novartis to treat nearly 50 million people.

The government said last week it would secure enough to treat a total of 77 million people by the end of March next year, with Japanese makers producing enough vaccine to treat 27 million people. It added that it would start importing vaccine from around the end of December or January.

Experts predict that a third of the global population - 2 billion people - will eventually be infected with H1N1, which was first seen in March in California and Mexico.

The World Health Organization said in late August that the new H1N1 swine flu had reached epidemic levels in Japan, signaling the early start to what may be a long influenza season this year.

The health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that the government had reached a deal with the two foreign makers, with a contract totaling 112.6 billion yen ($1.26 billion). It did not specify how much it would buy from each of the two companies.

A Japanese newspaper, the Asahi Shimbum, reported last month that the government would spend about a total of 100 billion yen to buy enough vaccine for 35 million people from GlaxoSmithKline and for another 12 million people from Novartis.

Talks on the purchases have been delayed due to liability concerns, with the foreign makers asking to get immunity from responsibility in case of any side effects from vaccination.

The government now plans to submit a bill to parliament so that it could pay compensation to patients who suffer from any side effects of imported vaccine or pay lawsuit-related costs on behalf of foreign makers.

Tokyo, which has set aside 138 billion yen in budgetary spending to buy H1N1 flu vaccines, plans to start administering vaccines from the week of October 19, with priority given to medical staff, high risk groups such as children, pregnant women and those with underlying medical problems, including diabetes and respiratory illnesses.

At home, four Japanese makers will produce H1N1 flu vaccine: Denka Seiken Co., Ltd, the Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University, the Kitasato Institute, and Kaketsuken (The Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Research Institute).

Three of them will start shipping the H1N1 flu vaccine from Friday, the health ministry said, to be ready for vaccination staring later this month. In Japan, one will need to pay a fixed cost of 6,150 yen ($69.06) to get two vaccination shots.

TOKYO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The Japanese government said on Tuesday it would buy enough H1N1 flu vaccine from British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Switzerland&apos;s Novartis (NOVN.VX) to treat nearly 50 million people.

    <body>By Jessica Hall and Phil Wahba

PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Hype about the swine flu vaccines, pent-up demand for cash and a push by major drugmakers to boost their flagging research pipelines has helped lift biotechnology fund-raising 36 percent so far this year.

Biotech firms have raised $5.7 billion through an assortment of 39 debt and share offerings, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Follow-on offerings have been the most prevalent form of fund-raising, with 29 such transactions, the data showed. (here)

Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) led the fund-raising with debt offerings that generated proceeds of $1.99 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

&quot;It&apos;s an opportunistic time to raise money -- there&apos;s a lot of attention on vaccines, cancer and emerging drugs to fill drug pipelines,&quot; said one healthcare investment banker who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch led the league tables in terms of biotech fund-raising activity. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) followed as No. 3 in terms of bookrunning, the data showed.

Some of the activity was driven by pent-up demand after weakness in financial markets made it difficult to raise money last year, and eroded many biotech&apos;s cash cushion.

&quot;Last year a combination of depressed valuations, limited investor appetite for risk and illiquid trading profiles created a scenario where many biotech companies were within one years worth of cash remaining,&quot; said Jim Cooney, managing director of Equity Capital Markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

&quot;Traditionally a biotech company would access the equity markets well in advance of eighteen months of cash remaining. When market sentiment improved and investors appetite for risk increased, a scenario was created for these companies to issue equity in an accelerated manner,&quot; Cooney said.

The wave of follow-ons in the sector comes at a time biotech stocks have surged. The Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI is up 33.9 percent since March lows.

&quot;If market performance continues the way we expect it to, with the demand we&apos;ve seen, the activity we&apos;ll see in the next 18-24 months will make this wave we&apos;ve had seem de minimis in nature,&quot; Cooney said.

Some capital raising came in the wake of excitement over H1N1 (swine flu) vaccines as several small companies used positive data trials as springboards for share offerings.

&quot;One strong study can set the stage for a new round of fund-raising or venture capital money,&quot; the investment banker said.

For example, Vical Inc (VICL.O) announced on May 21 that it had advanced the development of its H1N1 vaccine. The next day, Vical said it would sell shares worth $15.4 million. Four days after that, it said it would sell shares and options worth an additional $4.6 million.

Inovio BioMedical (INO.A) in July also followed on the success of its H1N1 vaccine in animal studies with news it would sell shares and warrants worth $30 million.

IPOs SHOW MIXED RESULTS

Biotech and pharma IPOs have been less prevalent and have had mixed results.

Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc, which broke a nearly two-year drought for IPOs in the drug sector, raised $85 mln in August, but its stock has dropped 9.1 percent since its debut.

Meanwhile, shares of Talecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp (TLCR.O) gained 11.3 percent in their first day of trading last week -- marking the largest biopharmaceuticals IPO in three years.

Unlike most IPOs in the sector, Talecris already has products on the market in addition to those in development, allowing it to attract more interest, analysts said.

Its products are used to treat a number of diseases, including immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders, infections and severe trauma.

&quot;The IPOs by Talecris and Cumberland Pharmaceuticals were able to come because both companies have approved products and have stable revenues -- investors might not quite be ready yet for more speculative biopharma IPOs,&quot; said Bill Buhr, IPO Strategist with Morningstar Inc&apos;s IPO Service.

Investors will gravitate towards the defensive healthcare industry and that will contribute to interest in a certain type of pharma IPO, according to Buhr.

BIOTECH M&amp;A SLUMPS

Overall mergers and acquisitions in the biotech sector have fallen amid the general slump in dealmaking. Worldwide M&amp;A for biotech has fallen 84.6 percent this year to $8.4 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters. U.S. merger activity in the sector is down 90.6 percent, data showed.

Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Citigroup lead the list of advisers for biotech M&amp;A, according to Thomson Reuters.

The largest biotech deal of the year was Bristol-Myers Squibb Co&apos;s (BMY.N) acquisition of antibody technology specialist Medarex for $2.4 billion, which marked a 90 percent premium, according to Thomson Reuters. (here)

Investors have bid up shares of similar companies such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) and Seattle Genetics Inc (SGEN.O) in the wake of the rich Medarex deal in hopes other mergers will surface.

The next-largest deals in biotech were Johnson &amp; Johnson&apos;s (JNJ.N) purchase of cancer drug developer Cougar Biotechnology Inc for $970 million and its $885 million purchase of an 18.4 percent stake in Irish drugmaker Elan Corp Plc.

&quot;Big pharma has been behind the curve in building their biopharma capabilities and have been making acquisitions. But there&apos;s still very limited appetite for very early stage companies,&quot; said a second health care investment banker who declined to be named.

* None of the vaccinated patients died of H1N1 swine flu

WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Mexican researchers say they have some evidence that the ordinary seasonal flu vaccine may offer some protection against the new pandemic H1N1 swine flu -- contrary to other studies.

They found that people who had been vaccinated against seasonal flu were far less likely to be sick or to die from H1N1 than people who had not been immunized against seasonal flu.

&quot;These results are to be considered cautiously and in no way indicate that seasonal vaccine should replace vaccination against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009,&quot; Lourdes Garcia-Garcia and colleagues at the National Institute of Public Health in Cuernavaca wrote in the British Medical Journal.

But they said the findings might offer some good news for people who have been vaccinated against seasonal flu, especially as governments are just beginning to distribute newly made swine flu vaccines.

The new H1N1 swine flu virus is a very distant cousin of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus, which is included in the mixture provided every year in the seasonal flu vaccine.

Most studies have shown the annual vaccine provides little or no protection against H1N1, likely because it is very different.

One study in Canada suggested that in fact people who got seasonal flu vaccines may be more likely to become infected with H1N1, although the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both expressed doubts about the findings.

Garcia&apos;s team studied 60 patients with confirmed swine flu and 180 similar people with other diseases being treated in the Mexico City area.

The Mexican government distributes seasonal flu vaccine.

Only eight people who had been vaccinated against seasonal flu were among the swine flu cases, the researchers reported. They found that 29 percent of unvaccinated people in the study became infected with H1N1, versus 13 percent of vaccinated people.

None of the vaccinated people died, but 35 percent of swine flu patients who died had not been vaccinated against seasonal flu, they found.

&quot;Seasonal vaccination might protect against the most severe forms of the disease,&quot; the researchers wrote.

Menno de Jong of the University of Amsterdam and Rogier Sanders of Cornell University in New York said the study shows some protection but said what the world really needs is a universal flu vaccine that protects people against all strains.

Currently, the seasonal vaccine must be formulated every year because influenza viruses mutate, and new strains, such as the H1N1 swine flu, require a completely new vaccine. The new H1N1 vaccine took five months to formulate and manufacture. (Reporting by Maggie Fox; Editing by Eric Walsh)</body>

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government said on Tuesday it would buy enough H1N1 flu vaccine from British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline and Switzerland&apos;s Novartis to treat nearly 50 million people.

The government said last week it would secure enough to treat a total of 77 million people by the end of March next year, with Japanese makers producing enough vaccine to treat 27 million people. It added that it would start importing vaccine from around the end of December or January.

Experts predict that a third of the global population - 2 billion people - will eventually be infected with H1N1, which was first seen in March in California and Mexico.

The World Health Organization said in late August that the new H1N1 swine flu had reached epidemic levels in Japan, signaling the early start to what may be a long influenza season this year.

The health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that the government had reached a deal with the two foreign makers, with a contract totaling 112.6 billion yen ($1.26 billion). It did not specify how much it would buy from each of the two companies.

A Japanese newspaper, the Asahi Shimbum, reported last month that the government would spend about a total of 100 billion yen to buy enough vaccine for 35 million people from GlaxoSmithKline and for another 12 million people from Novartis.

Talks on the purchases have been delayed due to liability concerns, with the foreign makers asking to get immunity from responsibility in case of any side effects from vaccination.

The government now plans to submit a bill to parliament so that it could pay compensation to patients who suffer from any side effects of imported vaccine or pay lawsuit-related costs on behalf of foreign makers.

Tokyo, which has set aside 138 billion yen in budgetary spending to buy H1N1 flu vaccines, plans to start administering vaccines from the week of October 19, with priority given to medical staff, high risk groups such as children, pregnant women and those with underlying medical problems, including diabetes and respiratory illnesses.

At home, four Japanese makers will produce H1N1 flu vaccine: Denka Seiken Co., Ltd, the Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University, the Kitasato Institute, and Kaketsuken (The Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Research Institute).

Three of them will start shipping the H1N1 flu vaccine from Friday, the health ministry said, to be ready for vaccination staring later this month. In Japan, one will need to pay a fixed cost of 6,150 yen ($69.06) to get two vaccination shots.

    <body>GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) restated its confidence in the H1N1 flu vaccine on Tuesday, calling it the most important tool against the pandemic.

Mild adverse side effects such as muscle cramps or headache are to be expected in some cases, but everyone who has access to the vaccine should be inoculated, it said.

Mass vaccination campaigns against the swine flu virus are underway in China and Australia and will be starting soon in the United States and parts of Europe, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said.

&quot;It is important to remember that the vaccines, which have already been approved, have been used for years and years and years in their seasonal vaccine formulation and have been shown to be among the safest vaccines that exist,&quot; he told a news briefing.

Hartl, asked whether WHO was concerned by reports that some people were reluctant to be injected with the new vaccine, said:

&quot;Certainly we have seen the reports. Again, we would restate that the most important tool that we have to fight this pandemic is the vaccine.&quot;

It was doubly important that health care workers be vaccinated, as it protects them as well as patients, he added.

&quot;We would hope that everyone who has a chance to get vaccinated does get vaccinated,&quot; Hartl told Reuters.

The United Nations agency declared in June that the H1N1 virus was causing an influenza pandemic and its collaborating laboratories have provided seed virus to drug makers worldwide to develop vaccines.

GlaxoSmithKline won a further 22 government orders for its H1N1 swine flu vaccine in the last two months, taking the total number of doses ordered to 440 million worth some $3.5 billion. Rivals in flu vaccines include Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis, Baxter, AstraZeneca and CSL.

    <body>(Adds details, background)

BEIJING, Oct 6 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday reported its first death from the H1N1 flu strain after weeks on alert against the disease.

The victim, who died on Sunday, was an 18-year-old woman from the Tibetan autonomous region, who had been admitted to hospital the previous day complaining of a sore throat, cough and aches, the official Xinhua agency said.

The Health Ministry confirmed the death, but declined to comment further.

The government has reported the death to the World Health Organisation and is now rushing 200,000 doses of vaccine to remote areas, state media said.

Health Minister Chen Zhu warned last month that China faced a grim situation in containing the disease as schools start up again and the number of cases rises. [ID:nPEK102128].

The government said at the end of September that there had been nearly 20,000 reported cases of the disease across the country, but over 14,000 had fully recovered and only 10 were seriously ill.

There are already strict checks at border crossings and many places where crowds gather like karaoke parlours, and the government began a mass vaccination programme in late September, starting with around 100,000 students in Beijing.

Zhu said at the time that the government aimed to produce 26 million doses of vaccine by the end of October, and 65 million doses by the end of 2009.

Public service providers and vulnerable groups in densely populated cities and travel hubs would have priority, he added.

China&apos;s Sinovac SVA.A reported last month that its vaccine protected patients with a single dose [ID:nPEK368343]. (Reporting by Beijing newsroom and Emma Graham-Harrison; Editing by Nick Macfie)</body>

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The new pandemic of H1N1 swine flu is causing a strong second wave of disease in many Northern Hemisphere countries, according to the World Health Organization.

While the United States, China and Australia have begun vaccination, other countries have not and it is unlikely many people will be protected from the virus before November. Here are some possible ways the pandemic could play out:

BECOMING PART OF THE MIX

The new H1N1 virus is a distant cousin of an H1N1 strain that has been part of the seasonal influenza mix for decades. Early surveillance suggests the new swine flu strain may supplant seasonal H1N1 and become part of the common circulating viruses. This could be good news as the seasonal H1N1 had developed resistance to the antiviral drug oseltamivir, Roche AG (ROG.VX) and Gilead Science&apos;s (GILD.O) pill sold under the Tamiflu brand name. But most viruses eventually mutate and health experts would not be surprised to see swine flu acquire resistance. That is why companies are working to develop newer and better influenza drugs.

The U.N&apos;s senior technical expert on influenza, Dr. Julie Hall, said it takes two to three years for a new influenza virus to infect enough of a population to create broad immunity.

ADDING A NEW DIMENSION

Because flu viruses mutate and recombine to form new strains, people remain vulnerable to flu all their lives. This is why the vaccine must be reformulated each year. H1N1 has been remarkably stable since it began infecting people widely in March and April this year. But experts predict once it has infected a certain proportion of the population -- no one knows exactly what proportion -- it will start to change.

Right now the H1N1 vaccine is a good match against the virus, and most adults and older children will get good protection with a single dose. If the virus &quot;drifts,&quot; the vaccine will have to be reformulated to match, just as with the seasonal flu vaccine. The process takes about six months.

Health officials will monitor closely for this to happen. In past pandemics, notably the one in 1918 that killed between 40 million and 100 million people globally, a first wave of relatively mild influenza was followed by a second wave of severe disease months later.

WHEN PIGS FLY

It is also possible that the virus will recombine, swapping genetic material with other flu viruses, such as the seasonal H3N2 virus. A special concern is that someone could become infected with both the H1N1 virus and the H5N1 avian flu virus. They could then combine to create an especially virulent new virus &quot;that would have very unpleasant consequences for humanity,&quot; United Nations special pandemic coordinator Dr. David Nabarro told a World Bank briefing on Sunday.

Bird flu is still circulating and has infected 442 people, killing 262 of them, since 2003, the World Health Organization says. It is difficult for people to catch bird flu but when they do it is highly deadly. If a new virus had H1N1&apos;s infectivity and H5N1&apos;s deadliness, it could be devastating.

Many companies are working on H5N1 vaccines, which could give the world a head start on a new vaccine if any eventual new mutant closely matches the strain being used to make it.

LACKING VACCINES

Whatever the virus does, the world lacks the capacity to vaccinate most of the population against flu. The WHO estimates worldwide production capacity for pandemic vaccines at approximately 3 billion doses a year, which would be enough to cover fewer than half the world&apos;s 6.8 billion people. The WHO is pressing rich countries to buy and donate vaccine to poorer countries.

Hall told the World Bank gathering that the first wave of the swine flu pandemic affected wealthier nations like the United States, Australia and Japan, where it is still active.

&quot;But what we are seeing now is that the virus is beginning to penetrate into some of the poorest communities in the world,&quot; she said. There it may cause &quot;explosive outbreaks&quot; among young and working-age adults -- a particular problem for countries with younger populations.

Joy Phumaphi of the World Bank estimates that even a mild epidemic will reduce world gross domestic product or GDP by 0.7 percent. A more severe epidemic could reduce GDP by 3 percent, as it not only takes people out of the workforce for days or weeks, but requires them to seek expensive medical care.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new pandemic of H1N1 swine flu is causing a strong second wave of disease in many Northern Hemisphere countries, according to the World Health Organization.

While the United States, China and Australia have begun vaccination, other countries have not and it is unlikely many people will be protected from the virus before November. Here are some possible ways the pandemic could play out:

BECOMING PART OF THE MIX

The new H1N1 virus is a distant cousin of an H1N1 strain that has been part of the seasonal influenza mix for decades. Early surveillance suggests the new swine flu strain may supplant seasonal H1N1 and become part of the common circulating viruses. This could be good news as the seasonal H1N1 had developed resistance to the antiviral drug oseltamivir, Roche AG and Gilead Science&apos;s pill sold under the Tamiflu brand name. But most viruses eventually mutate and health experts would not be surprised to see swine flu acquire resistance. That is why companies are working to develop newer and better influenza drugs.

The U.N&apos;s senior technical expert on influenza, Dr. Julie Hall, said it takes two to three years for a new influenza virus to infect enough of a population to create broad immunity.

ADDING A NEW DIMENSION

Because flu viruses mutate and recombine to form new strains, people remain vulnerable to flu all their lives. This is why the vaccine must be reformulated each year. H1N1 has been remarkably stable since it began infecting people widely in March and April this year. But experts predict once it has infected a certain proportion of the population -- no one knows exactly what proportion -- it will start to change.

Right now the H1N1 vaccine is a good match against the virus, and most adults and older children will get good protection with a single dose. If the virus &quot;drifts,&quot; the vaccine will have to be reformulated to match, just as with the seasonal flu vaccine. The process takes about six months.

Health officials will monitor closely for this to happen. In past pandemics, notably the one in 1918 that killed between 40 million and 100 million people globally, a first wave of relatively mild influenza was followed by a second wave of severe disease months later.

WHEN PIGS FLY

It is also possible that the virus will recombine, swapping genetic material with other flu viruses, such as the seasonal H3N2 virus. A special concern is that someone could become infected with both the H1N1 virus and the H5N1 avian flu virus. They could then combine to create an especially virulent new virus &quot;that would have very unpleasant consequences for humanity,&quot; United Nations special pandemic coordinator Dr. David Nabarro told a World Bank briefing on Sunday.

Bird flu is still circulating and has infected 442 people, killing 262 of them, since 2003, the World Health Organization says. It is difficult for people to catch bird flu but when they do it is highly deadly. If a new virus had H1N1&apos;s infectivity and H5N1&apos;s deadliness, it could be devastating.

Many companies are working on H5N1 vaccines, which could give the world a head start on a new vaccine if any eventual new mutant closely matches the strain being used to make it.

LACKING VACCINES

Whatever the virus does, the world lacks the capacity to vaccinate most of the population against flu. The WHO estimates worldwide production capacity for pandemic vaccines at approximately 3 billion doses a year, which would be enough to cover fewer than half the world&apos;s 6.8 billion people. The WHO is pressing rich countries to buy and donate vaccine to poorer countries.

Hall told the World Bank gathering that the first wave of the swine flu pandemic affected wealthier nations like the United States, Australia and Japan, where it is still active.

&quot;But what we are seeing now is that the virus is beginning to penetrate into some of the poorest communities in the world,&quot; she said. There it may cause &quot;explosive outbreaks&quot; among young and working-age adults -- a particular problem for countries with younger populations.

Joy Phumaphi of the World Bank estimates that even a mild epidemic will reduce world gross domestic product or GDP by 0.7 percent. A more severe epidemic could reduce GDP by 3 percent, as it not only takes people out of the workforce for days or weeks, but requires them to seek expensive medical care.

By Ben Hirschler

LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) won a further 22 government orders for its H1N1 swine flu vaccine in the last two months, taking the total number of doses ordered to 440 million worth some $3.5 billion.

The Britain-based drugmaker said on Tuesday first supplies were being shipped to governments this week and deliveries would continue through both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first half of 2010.

The addition of a further 149 million orders since Aug. 4, when Glaxo last gave an update, points to a substantial sales and profit windfall as a result of the swine flu pandemic.

Governments around the world are preparing to start mass immunisation programmes ahead of a feared second wave of infection as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

Glaxo previously said it expects to sell its H1N1 vaccine for around the same price as seasonal flu shots, which fetch about five pounds ($7.96) a dose, implying its total booked orders are now worth some 2.2 billion pounds ($3.5 billion).

It also has a variety of agreements in place with the U.S. government to supply pandemic products worth an additional $250 million and discussions are continuing with various other governments for further vaccine supplies.

&quot;The market may look through GSK&apos;s pandemic sales as being a one-off,&quot; Citigroup analyst Kevin Wilson said in a note.

&quot;However, we believe that pandemic sales will lead to potential earnings surprises through the fourth quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2010 when overlaid on the rest of the business, which is now set to recover from U.S. generic washouts.&quot;

Shipments of H1N1 vaccine will be delivered in both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first half of 2010, Glaxo said.

Rivals in flu vaccines include Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Novartis (NOVN.VX), Baxter (BAX.N), AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and CSL (CSL.AX).

But Glaxo believes it has an edge because its vaccine uses a special adjuvant -- a substance designed to boost the immune response -- which means only a fraction of the normal amount of antigen, or active ingredient, is needed in each shot.

In addition to bumper vaccine revenue, Glaxo also stands to book extra sales of flu drug Relenza, a rival to Roche&apos;s (ROG.VX) Tamiflu.

Shares in Glaxo were flat in a slightly weaker market for European drug stocks .SXDP by 0845 GMT. (Editing by Greg Mahlich and David Holmes) ($1=.6279 pounds)</body>

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Vaccination against the H1N1 swine flu is off to a slow start in the United States, but states have ordered more than 2 million doses of mostly nasal spray for the first patients, a top health official said on Tuesday.

Every state has ordered a share of the pandemic vaccine, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news briefing.

&quot;This week, as of yesterday, about 2.4 million doses were available for ordering,&quot; Frieden told reporters in a telephone briefing. He said states had ordered 2.2 million of the doses -- a painstaking process because they must specify which vaccine they want and have a plan in place for delivering it.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must inspect each lot of vaccine as it is packaged. &quot;Each day as more vaccine is cleared, more vaccine becomes available for ordering,&quot; Frieden added.

&quot;I think what we are seeing now is the tap beginning to flow. We are seeing a substantial amount of vaccine beginning to get out.&quot;

The first batches available are AstraZeneca (AZN.N) (AZN.L) unit MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray vaccine, which is approved for people aged 2 to 49 without asthma or other lung conditions.

Many states are opting to vaccinate healthcare workers first, who have a high risk both of being infected and of passing infections along to vulnerable patients.

The U.S. government has ordered 250 million doses and, given that many Americans skip flu shots every year, the CDC believes this will be enough to fill demand.

The CDC and World Health Organization are urging people everywhere to get the vaccine. Mass vaccination campaigns against the swine flu virus are also under way in China and Australia and will be starting soon in parts of Europe, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said on Tuesday. [ID:nL6260457].

WHO and the CDC both stressed that the pandemic H1N1 vaccine is made the same way as the seasonal flu vaccine and is both safe and effective.

&quot;What we have decided to do is make vaccine available as soon as it comes off the production lines,&quot; Frieden said. &quot;That means it is becoming available in lots. It is a little bit of a messy process and we do expect it to be a little bit bumpy in the next few weeks.&quot;

And it will be a strain to keep up with the virus. &quot;As of today, influenza is widespread in most of the United States,&quot; Frieden said. &quot;We are seeing it continue to increase in some areas.&quot;

Nonetheless, he noted, when H1N1 goes through a community, it infects about 5 percent of the people, leaving 95 percent vulnerable to a fresh round.

&quot;You don&apos;t know what the rest of this long flu season is going to hold. We haven&apos;t had a flu season like this in at least 50 years,&quot; Frieden said.

TUNIS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Tunisia has barred its citizens from making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca for the first time because of a lack of swine flu vaccines, the government said on Tuesday.

The Ministry of Religious Affairs said a batch of H1N1 flu jabs would not arrive before mid-October, too late to ensure candidates for the pilgrimage, or haj, are vaccinated.

Saudi Arabia&apos;s embassy in Tunis said the haj will take place from around Nov. 18.

Millions of Muslims, including up to 10,000 Tunisians, flock to Mecca each year for the haj, a pillar of Islamic observance.

Saudi Arabia has urged the elderly and people with chronic diseases to postpone trips this year.

Several Muslim countries have sought to limit numbers travelling to Mecca but Tunisia is the first to formally cancel the pilgrimage.

Businesses in Islam&apos;s holiest city are already counting the losses, with shops, hotels and tour operators reporting a marked decline in visitors.

The H1N1 virus had killed 3,917 people in 191 countries since being identified in April, according to World Health Organisation figures provided on Sept. 20.

No one has yet died from swine flu in Tunisia, which has documented 80 cases of the virus so far.

WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Vaccination against the H1N1 swine flu is off to a slow start in the United States, but states have ordered more than 2 million doses of mostly nasal spray for the first patients, a top health official said on Tuesday.

Many states are opting to vaccinate healthcare workers first, who have a high risk both of being infected and of passing infections along to vulnerable patients.

WAITING FOR SHOTS

But at least three Chicago-area hospitals that have received the nasal spray vaccine said they would not be using it to immunize hospital staff because it is made from a weakened version of a live virus, unlike shots, which are made using a killed virus, and there is a very small chance of infecting someone with a weak immune system.

Dr. John Segreti, an infectious diseases expert at Rush University Medical Center, said the hospital had received 2,000 doses of the nasal spray.

&quot;We&apos;re going to be distributing it to clinics that see children. We&apos;re not using this for our healthcare workers. We&apos;re waiting for the inactivated vaccine for our health workers,&quot; he said.

Officials at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the University of Chicago Medical Center said they also will be waiting for the shots to immunize hospital workers.

The U.S. government has ordered 250 million doses and, given that many Americans skip flu shots every year, the CDC believes this will be enough to fill demand.

    <body>HANOI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - These are some of the leading stories in the official Vietnamese press on Wednesday. Reuters has not verified these stories.

FINANCIAL NEWS:

THOI BAO KINH TE VIETNAM -- HSBC (HSBA.L) is to increase its stake in Bao Viet Holdings BVH.HM by 8 percent under a mutual agreement signed on Oct. 5.

ECONOMIC AND GENERAL NEWS:

VIETNAM NEWS

-- Foreign tourists will be allowed to use right-hand-drive cars for a maximum 30 days in Vietnam following a government decree which will come into force on Nov. 15.

NHAN DAN

-- The Asian Indoor Games will be held in Vietnam from Oct. 30 to Nov. 8, with sportsmen competing from 45 countries and territories.

QUAN DOI NHAN DAN

-- The government should consider tightening monetary policies and it would be reasonable for the dong&apos;s base rate to be lifted to 8.5-9 percent, said Le Dinh An, director of the Planning and Investment Ministry&apos;s National Socio-Economic Forecast and Information Centre. An said the exchange rate should be 18,000-18,500 dong VND= per dollar to boost exports. (Reporting by Hanoi Newsroom)</body>

By Sui-Lee Wee and Joanne Chiu

HONG KONG, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) and Air New Zealand (AIR.NZ) said they were seeing some signs of improving demand but cautioned a sustained recovery in the battered air travel market was still far from certain.

Carriers have been hit hard as the weak global economy has caused consumers and businesses to curtail spending on travel. Demand has also been hurt by this year&apos;s outbreak of the H1N1 virus.

However, Singapore Air, the world&apos;s biggest airline by market value, has seen its load factors and yields, two key measures of demand and profitability, improve in recent months, its CEO said on Tuesday.

&quot;The trends are moving in the right direction. We hope it will hold, but it&apos;s hard to tell,&quot; Chew Choon Seng told reporters on the sidelines of an aviation conference in Hong Kong.

&quot;Unemployment in the United States is still 10 percent, which is very high,&quot; he said.

Singapore Air&apos;s yields would remain negative through to the end of the year as the sector struggles in the economic downturn, even though they have improved in the quarter ended September, Chew said.

Yields represent the average revenue from each seat sold and help determine whether routes are profitable, while load factors measure how many available seats are occupied.

Both executives from Singapore Air and Air NZ said their load factors have improved, reflecting the global trend of a slowing decline in air traffic. [ID:nL8267258].

But Air New Zealand said passenger yields will only recover by the end of 2010.

&quot;We&apos;re starting to see a recovery in passenger demand, but it&apos;s very early days yet,&quot; CEO Rob Fyfe told Reuters. &quot;We&apos;ve seen an improvement over the last two to three months.&quot;

&quot;What we&apos;re not seeing is an improvement in yields and ticket prices,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not convinced this recovery in demand can be sustained.&quot;

The cautious comments from both executives mirror the outlook issued by the International Air Transport Association, which said the airline industry remains well away from a return to profit, even though air traffic demand is recovering. [ID:nLT509941].

In September, IATA raised its forecast for total airline losses in 2009 by $2 billion to a record $11 billion. [ID:nN151702].

RECOVERY NEXT YEAR

Analysts agreed that the outlook for the sector in the short term was grim but should improve next year.

&quot;In terms of yields, they will remain low,&quot; said Jay Ryu, head of regional transport for Mirae Asset Securities. &quot;But in the second half of 2010 we will start seeing positive improvement in yields.&quot;

&quot;In late 2010, the recovery will be pretty strong,&quot; he said, adding that the recovery would be propped up by demand from developed countries.

The load factor of Singapore Airlines, 55 percent owned by state investor Temasek Holdings, rose to 80 percent in September, he said. This surpassed 68.2 percent recorded in August and 69.7 percent in July.

Singapore Air and Air NZ will not cut more capacity in the near term, both executives said.

The airline industry has made deep capacity cuts to compensate for rising oil prices and weak demand and many have cancelled or defered plane orders.

Singapore&apos;s flag carrier said in February it would reduce overall capacity by 11 percent and ground 17 aircraft in the financial year ending March 2010.

On Monday, Cathay Pacific (0293.HK) CEO Tony Tyler said the airline last week posted its best weekly passenger load factor for 2009, but remained uncertain whether the improvement represented a structural improvement or merely reflected seasonal factors. [ID:nSEO107656].

Singapore Airlines shares ended up 0.8 percent, while Air NZ shares outpeformed, gaining 4.1 percent. Cathay shares were up 6.1 percent in Hong Kong. (Additional reporting by Nerilyn Tenorio; Editing by Lincoln Feast)</body>

WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Healthcare workers in Indiana and Tennessee began getting the first U.S. pandemic H1N1 vaccines on Monday as part of what the government hopes will be a mass immunization effort, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Vaccinations were scheduled for clinic staff at Le Bonheur Children&apos;s Medical Center in Memphis, Tennessee, and Wishard Health Services in Indianapolis, the CDC said.

The first H1N1 swine flu vaccines to be administered will be AstraZeneca (AZN.L) unit MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray, which was the first to be finished, packaged and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The U.S. government has ordered about 250 million doses from five companies -- Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and MedImmune.

The CDC says 47 U.S. states have ordered 1.38 million doses of the vaccine so far, with more orders to come from a total of 90,000 states, counties, cities and individual buyers such as retailers.

Healthcare workers, pregnant women and people with special health conditions including heart disease and diabetes are among the 160 million people CDC has said should be the first in line to get the vaccine.

The vaccines will trickle in at a rate of about 20 million doses a week, and officials are unsure how many Americans will actually get them. The U.S. government is providing them for free, but clinics and retailers may charge to administer them.

At least two surveys have suggested that demand may be somewhat higher for the swine flu vaccine than for the seasonal influenza vaccine.

A survey by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions and Harris Interactive found that 53 percent of Americans say they plan to get vaccinated, compared with 41 percent who say they will not be vaccinated.

MANY CHILDREN TO BE VACCINATED

The same percentages for Americans overall were seen in a survey released last week by the Harvard School of Public Health. It also found that 75 percent of parents planned to get their children vaccinated against H1N1.

A survey by Consumer Reports found only 35 percent of Americans would definitely have their children vaccinated.

The CDC says about 40 percent of young children aged 2 to 4 are usually vaccinated against influenza, 38 percent of adults aged 50 to 64, and 66 percent of people over the age of 65, who are the most likely to die from seasonal influenza.

The picture is complicated by seasonal flu vaccination, which started last month. Officials say people need both vaccinations to be protected from both seasonal flu and the pandemic H1N1 strain.

Swine flu has been circulating since it was first identified in two U.S. children last April but it has picked up speed since August as schools returned from summer breaks.

As of Oct. 2, the World Health Organization says it has 343,298 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 globally with at least 4,108 deaths -- but experts note these numbers do not reflect the true extent of the pandemic.

The global system for reporting influenza cases and deaths is often weeks or months behind the actual spread of disease and only a fraction of the cases or deaths are tested.

Dozens of children and at least 28 pregnant women in the United States have died from the virus and at least 100 pregnant women were sick enough to be hospitalized in intensive care, the CDC said. (Editing by Philip Barbara)</body>

    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Healthcare workers in Indiana and Tennessee will be among the first to get swine flu vaccines in the United States on Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Vaccination clinics are scheduled for Monday morning for staff at Le Bonheur Children&apos;s Medical Center in Memphis, Tennessee and Wishard Health Services in Indianapolis, the CDC said.

Last week, the center said the first doses of H1N1 swine flu vaccine would arrive on Tuesday. The first vaccines to administered will be AstraZeneca unit MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray.

The U.S. government has ordered about 250 million doses from five companies -- Sanofi-Aventis SA, CSL Ltd MedImmune, Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline. MedImmune had especially good production of the H1N1 vaccine and has been the first to make doses available.

The vaccines will trickle in at a rate of about 20 million doses a week, and officials are unsure how many Americans will actually get them. The U.S. government is providing them for free,

but clinics and retailers may charge to administer them.

The picture is further complicated by seasonal flu vaccination, which started last month.

Pandemic H1N1 has been circulating since it was first identified in two U.S. children last March but it has picked up speed since schools returned from their summer break in August.

The CDC said it is not especially deadly, but it is affecting younger people than seasonal flu usually does and at a time of year when there is generally little or no influenza.

Dozens of children and at least 28 pregnant women in the United States have died from the virus and at least 100 pregnant women were sick enough with it to be hospitalized, the CDC said.

Pregnant women, healthcare workers and people with special health conditions including heart disease and diabetes are supposed to be the first to get the vaccine.</body>

    <body>ISTANBUL, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Rich countries should make more vaccine available to poorer nations where the H1N1 virus is starting to hit, U.N. health officials said on Sunday.

They said increased readiness for swine flu was needed in developing countries with weaker medical systems and with large, young populations, who are most vulnerable to the disease.

&quot;We may well see a different pattern of impact once this virus starts to take off and those explosive outbreaks occur in some of the poorer communities in the world,&quot; said Julie Hall, an infections disease expert at the World Health Organisation, a U.N. agency.

The WHO, which declared H1N1 a global pandemic in June, says a third of the world&apos;s population of nearly 7 billion people could catch it.

Some countries, such as the United States, Brazil and France, have agreed to make 10 percent of their national vaccine stockpile available to developing countries. Manufacturers have also donated about 150 million doses of vaccine.

More is needed, said David Nabarro, the U.N. coordinator for fighting new emerging flu varieties.

&quot;The challenge during the next few weeks is to build up the solidarity between wealthy nations and poor nations to ensure that adequate vaccine is made available,&quot; he said.

September and October are usually just the start of flu season in the northern hemisphere, but there are signs of a second H1N1 wave after it first flared this year, Hall said.

&quot;Already we are seeing the U.S., many European countries, Japan and Mexico reporting over the past few weeks a sudden increase in cases,&quot; she said.

As of Sept. 20, swine flu had killed 3,917 people in 191 countries since being identified in April, the WHO has said. (Reporting by Simon Rabinovitch)</body>

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Days before the swine flu vaccine becomes available, more than half of U.S. adults say they will get the vaccine for themselves and 75 percent will get it for their children, according to a survey released on Friday.

Forty percent said they would not get the H1N1 vaccine, the team at the Harvard School of Public Health found.

&quot;These findings suggest that public health officials need to be prepared for a surge in demand for the H1N1 vaccine if the H1N1 flu becomes more severe,&quot; said Harvard&apos;s Robert Blendon, who led the study.

The survey conflicts with one published earlier this week by Consumer Reports showing only 35 percent of Americans would definitely have their children vaccinated.

The Harvard researchers polled 1,042 U.S. adults for what they said was a representative sample of national opinion late last month.

The poll results suggest more people would get a swine flu vaccine than usually get vaccinated against seasonal influenza in the United States, where flu kills an estimated 36,000 mostly elderly people a year.

H1N1 swine flu was declared a pandemic in June and it has circulated globally ever since.

Companies have been rushing to make and distribute vaccines for H1N1 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the first 600,000 doses will arrive in cities, states and counties that ordered them next week.

The U.S. government has ordered about 250 million doses from five companies -- Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA), CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), AstraZeneca Plc&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit, Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) (NVS.N) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) (GSK.N).

The vaccines will trickle in at a rate of about 20 million doses a week, and officials are unsure how many Americans will actually get them. The U.S. government is providing them for free but clinics and retailers may charge to administer them.

The picture is further complicated by seasonal flu vaccination, which started last month.

RUNNING OUT OF BEDS

A report from the Trust for Americas Health this week predicted that 15 states could run out of hospital beds if 35 percent of Americans catch the virus in coming weeks. Patients with severe cases of H1N1 infection often need specialized care and ventilators to breathe.

Blendon&apos;s team found that 53 percent of adults plan to get vaccinated and 75 percent of the parents would get their children vaccinated.

Sixty percent of those who said they would not vaccinate their children feared a serious illness from the vaccine.

About half were concerned that they or a family member may get seriously ill and 47 percent said they were not.

But most -- 64 percent -- felt that public health officials were right to be concerned about swine flu.

The CDC says about a third of infants and 40 percent of young children usually get a seasonal flu vaccine, as well as 66 percent of people over the age of 65, who are the most likely to die from seasonal influenza.

Adults with high risk conditions such as asthma or diabetes are strongly advised to get a seasonal flu shot, and about 40 percent of them usually do.

Only 24 percent of pregnant women, who have a high risk of severe complications from any strain of flu, get vaccinated. The CDC says 28 pregnant women have died in the United States from swine flu. (Editing by Mohammad Zargham)</body>

The Harvard researchers polled 1,042 U.S. adults for what they said was a representative sample of national opinion late last month.

The poll results suggest more people would get a swine flu vaccine than usually get vaccinated against seasonal influenza in the United States, where flu kills an estimated 36,000 mostly elderly people a year.

H1N1 swine flu was declared a pandemic in June and it has circulated globally ever since.

Companies have been rushing to make and distribute vaccines for H1N1 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the first 600,000 doses will arrive in cities, states and counties that ordered them next week.

The U.S. government has ordered about 250 million doses from five companies -- Sanofi-Aventis SA, CSL Ltd, AstraZeneca Plc&apos;s MedImmune unit, Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline.

The vaccines will trickle in at a rate of about 20 million doses a week, and officials are unsure how many Americans will actually get them. The U.S. government is providing them for free but clinics and retailers may charge to administer them.

The picture is further complicated by seasonal flu vaccination, which started last month.

RUNNING OUT OF BEDS

A report from the Trust for Americas Health this week predicted that 15 states could run out of hospital beds if 35 percent of Americans catch the virus in coming weeks. Patients with severe cases of H1N1 infection often need specialized care and ventilators to breathe.

Blendon&apos;s team found that 53 percent of adults plan to get vaccinated and 75 percent of the parents would get their children vaccinated.

Sixty percent of those who said they would not vaccinate their children feared a serious illness from the vaccine.

About half were concerned that they or a family member may get seriously ill and 47 percent said they were not.

But most -- 64 percent -- felt that public health officials were right to be concerned about swine flu.

The CDC says about a third of infants and 40 percent of young children usually get a seasonal flu vaccine, as well as 66 percent of people over the age of 65, who are the most likely to die from seasonal influenza.

Adults with high risk conditions such as asthma or diabetes are strongly advised to get a seasonal flu shot, and about 40 percent of them usually do.

Only 24 percent of pregnant women, who have a high risk of severe complications from any strain of flu, get vaccinated. The CDC says 28 pregnant women have died in the United States from swine flu.

* H1N1 pandemic should spur efforts on universal flu jab

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The H1N1 swine flu pandemic should spur pharmaceutical researchers to renew efforts to develop a universal flu vaccine and rethink ways of dealing with future pandemics, scientists said on Friday.

Flu experts from the World Health Organisation, Swiss drug giant Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), the U.S. National Institutes of Health and others noted that the arrival of H1N1 had prompted a jump in the potential output of vaccine manufacturing to 900 million doses from 400 million.

But in a letter to the journal Science, they urged drug and health industries to be more proactive in developing and distributing vaccines -- and in particular to speed up the search for a universal flu vaccine.

&quot;Although the H1N1 pandemic has the potential to cause a social and economic emergency, it also provides an opportunity to rethink our approach to influenza virus disease and to develop more effective vaccines and economically sustainable solutions for developing and developed countries,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Research toward development of a universal vaccine should be accelerated.&quot;

A universal flu vaccine which would combat all strains of the virus has so far eluded pharmaceutical firms and scientists.

Inovio Biomedical Corp (INO.A), which is working on such a vaccine, said this week that it expects initial evidence early next year on whether the technology it is using can help to fight diseases.

Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N), the world&apos;s biggest diversified health care company, recently bought a stake in Dutch biotech firm Crucell partly to get hold of flu-mAb, a universal antibody engineered to prevent and treat infections from various influenza A strains.

The swine flu outbreak was declared a pandemic in June and has already infected millions of people around the world. Drugmakers and governments have been scrambling to make and supply vaccines targeting the new H1N1 strain before a feared second wave of infection hits as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

The flu experts, including Dr David Salisbury, director of immunisation at Britain&apos;s Department of Health, and Dr John Treanor, who tests flu vaccines at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, criticised the current approach to flu as &quot;reactive rather than anticipatory&quot;.

&quot;We have already learned a great deal about fighting influenza, but we need to move from a reactive to a proactive and sustainable stance,&quot; they wrote.

They said better flu surveillance methods were needed in developing countries to understand how such viruses circulate globally and affect morbidity and mortality.

They also proposed strengthening epidemiological studies in developing countries to try to fill &quot;knowledge gaps&quot; about the virus, including the role of antibodies, immune memory, and T-cells that recognise and destroy viruses. (Editing by Maggie Fox/David Stamp)</body>

LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - European drugs regulators recommended Baxter&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan vaccine against H1N1 flu for approval on Friday and said it expected the shot to get a licence from the European Commission &quot;shortly&quot;.

The recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) comes after its expert committee on new drugs also gave a green light last week to the first H1N1 swine flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX), called Pandemrix and Focetria.

Governments and manufacturers have been scrambling for vaccines to target the new H1N1 flu strain, ahead of a feared second wave of infection as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

The Baxter vaccine, which was submitted for approval by EMEA under the fast-track &quot;mock-up&quot; procedure, is a non-adjuvanted vaccine, which means it does not contain adjuvants, or boosters, to enhance the immune response.

U.S. drugs authorities have expressed a preference for vaccines without adjuvants, and the five vaccines approved for the U.S. market do not use them.

The London-based watchdog said it was confident the new vaccines were safe, despite being rushed through the approval process. It said all three manufacturers would have to carry out safety studies in 9,000 subjects for each vaccine after launch.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said last week that drugmakers would only be able to produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet -- around 3 billion doses a year -- meaning governments will have to decide who should get the limited supplies.

The WHO also said a single dose should be enough to give healthy adults and older children immunity to the virus commonly known as swine flu, which was declared a pandemic in June.

But EMEA said its expert committee recommended a two-dose vaccination programme over a three week period for adults, including pregnant women, and children from six months of age.

&quot;Clinical trials in adults and in children are ongoing, and more results will become available from mid-October 2009 onwards,&quot; it said in a statement.

British health authorities said in August they had received around 200,000 doses of Baxter&apos;s swine flu vaccine and were waiting for it to be approved by licensing bodies. (Editing by Will Waterman)</body>

    <body>By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO (Reuters) - In-store flu vaccinations helped Walgreen Co (WAG.N), the largest U.S. drugstore chain, post on Friday a better-than-expected 5.3 percent jump in September sales at its stores open at least a year.

Same-store sales of general merchandise, which have suffered as consumers curb nonessential spending, also rose for the first time since May. Shares of Walgreen, which had already jumped 13.4 percent this week, hit their highest level since April 2008 before paring those gains.

Retailers kicked off their seasonal flu vaccinations earlier than usual this year amid raised awareness of the flu with the H1N1 pandemic. Walgreen is expected to see the biggest jump in revenue and profit from the strategy.

Walgreen has gained 1 percentage point of market share since April, as has its next-largest rival, CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N), according to IBISWorld. Walgreen currently controls 27 percent of the market, while CVS holds 26 percent, according to the firm. Rite Aid has had 12 percent share since December.

Also on Friday, CVS said it expects to have about one-third fewer low-income subsidy members enrolled in its two Medicare Part D plans next year, which will trim earnings.

FLU DRIVES GAINS

At Walgreen, pharmacy same-store sales rose 7 percent while same-store sales of general merchandise rose 2 percent.

Analysts, on average, expected a 3 percent rise in overall same-store sales, with pharmacy same-store sales up 4 percent and general merchandise same-store sales up 0.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Pali Capital analyst Robert Summers, who had forecast just a 1.8 percent same-store sales increase, said the results were &quot;impressive&quot; but &quot;likely not sustainable.&quot;

The number of prescriptions filled at existing stores jumped 12 percent, including 5.2 percentage points due to pharmacists administering seasonal flu shots.

Such sales also got a 1.4 percentage point boost from more patients filling 90-day prescriptions, which count as three 30-day prescriptions in the month that they are filled.

Walgreen, which administered 1.2 million seasonal flu vaccines in last year&apos;s flu season, has already given more than 2.4 million this season and aims to administer 5 million.

Analysts have said that giving more flu shots could help drive other sales, if people who come in for vaccinations decide to buy items such as cosmetics and candy.

The benefit of flu-related sales &quot;should fade over the next 4-6 weeks or so based on current patterns,&quot; said Summers, who has a &quot;neutral&quot; rating on Walgreen shares.

&quot;We have never been big believers in buying or selling stocks on flu. It happens every year. Sometimes it&apos;s good, other times not. This year however, appears to be well above average.&quot;

Walgreen&apos;s total September sales jumped 10.3 percent to $5.35 billion.

RITE AID SALES DROP

Walgreen&apos;s growth contrasted with a report from Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), the No. 3 U.S. drugstore. On Thursday, Rite Aid said its same-store sales fell 0.3 percent in the four weeks ended September 26. Rite Aid&apos;s pharmacy same-store sales rose 0.7 percent, while general merchandise same-store sales fell 2.3 percent.

While Rite Aid&apos;s sales declined, they also topped expectations.

The introduction of generic drugs over the past year cut into pharmacy sales at both chains. Such drugs carry lower revenue, but are typically more profitable for drugstores.

CVS does not issue monthly sales reports.

The shares of Walgreen, which has 7,045 stores across the country, closed down 14 cents at $38.05 after rising to $38.75. The shares got a big boost on Tuesday, when Walgreen&apos;s quarterly profit topped expectations.

CVS shares closed down 1.5 percent at $35.32, while Rite Aid shares fell 6.6 percent, to $1.41.

BUENOS AIRES, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Argentina&apos;s September tax take rose more than expected, or 9.8 percent from a year earlier to 26.23 billion pesos ($6.83 billion), the economy ministry said on Friday.

Ricardo Echegaray, the head of the AFIP tax agency, said September&apos;s revenue showed &quot;a good performance, better than expected.&quot;

The median forecast in a Reuters poll of seven analysts was for a tax take of 25.90 billion pesos. September&apos;s tax revenue was 12.2 percent higher than August, the government figures showed.

Argentina&apos;s tax revenue growth slowed in the past couple of months, affected in part by an outbreak of the H1N1 virus that kept many Argentines away from shopping centers and tourist areas.

Argentina&apos;s tax revenue is tracked by economists as a gauge of the country&apos;s ability to repay debt.

LONDON (Reuters) - The H1N1 swine flu pandemic should spur pharmaceutical researchers to renew efforts to develop a universal flu vaccine and rethink ways of dealing with future pandemics, scientists said on Friday.

Flu experts from the World Health Organization, Swiss drug giant Novartis AG, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and others noted that the arrival of H1N1 had prompted a jump in the potential output of vaccine manufacturing to 900 million doses from 400 million.

But in a letter to the journal Science, they urged drug and health industries to be more proactive in developing and distributing vaccines -- and in particular to speed up the search for a universal flu vaccine.

&quot;Although the H1N1 pandemic has the potential to cause a social and economic emergency, it also provides an opportunity to rethink our approach to influenza virus disease and to develop more effective vaccines and economically sustainable solutions for developing and developed countries,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Research toward development of a universal vaccine should be accelerated.&quot;

A universal flu vaccine which would combat all strains of the virus has so far eluded pharmaceutical firms and scientists.

Inovio Biomedical Corp, which is working on such a vaccine, said this week that it expects initial evidence early next year on whether the technology it is using can help to fight diseases.

Johnson &amp; Johnson, the world&apos;s biggest diversified health care company, recently bought a stake in Dutch biotech firm Crucell partly to get hold of flu-mAb, a universal antibody engineered to prevent and treat infections from various influenza A strains.

The swine flu outbreak was declared a pandemic in June and has already infected millions of people around the world. Drugmakers and governments have been scrambling to make and supply vaccines targeting the new H1N1 strain before a feared second wave of infection hits as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

The flu experts, including Dr David Salisbury, director of immunization at Britain&apos;s Department of Health, and Dr John Treanor, who tests flu vaccines at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, criticized the current approach to flu as &quot;reactive rather than anticipatory.&quot;

&quot;We have already learned a great deal about fighting influenza, but we need to move from a reactive to a proactive and sustainable stance,&quot; they wrote.

They said better flu surveillance methods were needed in developing countries to understand how such viruses circulate globally and affect morbidity and mortality.

They also proposed strengthening epidemiological studies in developing countries to try to fill &quot;knowledge gaps&quot; about the virus, including the role of antibodies, immune memory, and T-cells that recognize and destroy viruses.

LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - European drugs regulators recommended Baxter&apos;s (BAX.N) Celvapan vaccine against H1N1 flu for approval on Friday and said it expected the shot to get a licence from the European Commission &quot;shortly&quot;.

The recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) comes after its expert committee on new drugs also gave a green light last week to the first H1N1 swine flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX), called Pandemrix and Focetria.

Governments and manufacturers have been scrambling for vaccines to target the new H1N1 flu strain, ahead of a feared second wave of infection as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

The Baxter vaccine, which was submitted for approval by EMEA under the fast-track &quot;mock-up&quot; procedure, is a non-adjuvanted vaccine, which means it does not contain adjuvants, or boosters, to enhance the immune response.

U.S. drugs authorities have expressed a preference for vaccines without adjuvants, and the five vaccines approved for the U.S. market do not use them.

The London-based watchdog said it was confident the new vaccines were safe, despite being rushed through the approval process. It said all three manufacturers would have to carry out safety studies in 9,000 subjects for each vaccine after launch.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said last week that drugmakers would only be able to produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet -- around 3 billion doses a year -- meaning governments will have to decide who should get the limited supplies.

The WHO also said a single dose should be enough to give healthy adults and older children immunity to the virus commonly known as swine flu, which was declared a pandemic in June.

But EMEA said its expert committee recommended a two-dose vaccination programme over a three week period for adults, including pregnant women, and children from six months of age.

&quot;Clinical trials in adults and in children are ongoing, and more results will become available from mid-October 2009 onwards,&quot; it said in a statement.

British health authorities said in August they had received around 200,000 doses of Baxter&apos;s swine flu vaccine and were waiting for it to be approved by licensing bodies. (Editing by Will Waterman)</body>

    <body>By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO (Reuters) - In-store flu vaccinations helped Walgreen Co (WAG.N), the largest U.S. drugstore chain, post on Friday a better-than-expected 5.3 percent jump in September sales at its stores open at least a year.

Same-store sales of general merchandise, which have suffered as consumers curb nonessential spending, also rose for the first time since May. Shares of Walgreen, which had already jumped 13.4 percent this week, hit their highest level since April 2008 before paring those gains.

Retailers kicked off their seasonal flu vaccinations earlier than usual this year amid raised awareness of the flu with the H1N1 pandemic. Walgreen is expected to see the biggest jump in revenue and profit from the strategy.

Walgreen has gained 1 percentage point of market share since April, as has its next-largest rival, CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N), according to IBISWorld. Walgreen currently controls 27 percent of the market, while CVS holds 26 percent, according to the firm. Rite Aid has had 12 percent share since December.

Also on Friday, CVS said it expects to have about one-third fewer low-income subsidy members enrolled in its two Medicare Part D plans next year, which will trim earnings.

FLU DRIVES GAINS

At Walgreen, pharmacy same-store sales rose 7 percent while same-store sales of general merchandise rose 2 percent.

Analysts, on average, expected a 3 percent rise in overall same-store sales, with pharmacy same-store sales up 4 percent and general merchandise same-store sales up 0.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Pali Capital analyst Robert Summers, who had forecast just a 1.8 percent same-store sales increase, said the results were &quot;impressive&quot; but &quot;likely not sustainable.&quot;

The number of prescriptions filled at existing stores jumped 12 percent, including 5.2 percentage points due to pharmacists administering seasonal flu shots.

Such sales also got a 1.4 percentage point boost from more patients filling 90-day prescriptions, which count as three 30-day prescriptions in the month that they are filled.

Walgreen, which administered 1.2 million seasonal flu vaccines in last year&apos;s flu season, has already given more than 2.4 million this season and aims to administer 5 million.

Analysts have said that giving more flu shots could help drive other sales, if people who come in for vaccinations decide to buy items such as cosmetics and candy.

The benefit of flu-related sales &quot;should fade over the next 4-6 weeks or so based on current patterns,&quot; said Summers, who has a &quot;neutral&quot; rating on Walgreen shares.

&quot;We have never been big believers in buying or selling stocks on flu. It happens every year. Sometimes it&apos;s good, other times not. This year however, appears to be well above average.&quot;

Walgreen&apos;s total September sales jumped 10.3 percent to $5.35 billion.

RITE AID SALES DROP

Walgreen&apos;s growth contrasted with a report from Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), the No. 3 U.S. drugstore. On Thursday, Rite Aid said its same-store sales fell 0.3 percent in the four weeks ended September 26. Rite Aid&apos;s pharmacy same-store sales rose 0.7 percent, while general merchandise same-store sales fell 2.3 percent.

While Rite Aid&apos;s sales declined, they also topped expectations.

The introduction of generic drugs over the past year cut into pharmacy sales at both chains. Such drugs carry lower revenue, but are typically more profitable for drugstores.

CVS does not issue monthly sales reports.

The shares of Walgreen, which has 7,045 stores across the country, closed down 14 cents at $38.05 after rising to $38.75. The shares got a big boost on Tuesday, when Walgreen&apos;s quarterly profit topped expectations.

CVS shares closed down 1.5 percent at $35.32, while Rite Aid shares fell 6.6 percent, to $1.41.

BUENOS AIRES, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Argentina&apos;s September tax take rose more than expected, or 9.8 percent from a year earlier to 26.23 billion pesos ($6.83 billion), the economy ministry said on Friday.

Ricardo Echegaray, the head of the AFIP tax agency, said September&apos;s revenue showed &quot;a good performance, better than expected.&quot;

The median forecast in a Reuters poll of seven analysts was for a tax take of 25.90 billion pesos. September&apos;s tax revenue was 12.2 percent higher than August, the government figures showed.

Argentina&apos;s tax revenue growth slowed in the past couple of months, affected in part by an outbreak of the H1N1 virus that kept many Argentines away from shopping centers and tourist areas.

Argentina&apos;s tax revenue is tracked by economists as a gauge of the country&apos;s ability to repay debt.

($1 = 3.8425 Argentine pesos)

Oct 1 (Reuters) - Vical Inc (VICL.O) said it received a contract for about $1.3 million from the U.S. Navy to support manufacturing and clinical studies of its vaccine for the H1N1 swine flu, sending its shares up as much as 22 percent.

The trials will be conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), a biomedical research organization within the Navy, the DNA-vaccine maker said in a statement.

In May, Vical entered into a cooperative research and development agreement with NMRC to develop its Vaxfectin-formulated DNA vaccine for H1N1 influenza.

Vaxfectin is the company&apos;s experimental influenza product.

Last month, the company, which has already initiated manufacturing activities, said it would start human clinical trials within four to six weeks of receiving funding from the U.S. Navy.

The company&apos;s flu vaccine showed strong immune responses in animals against the virus strains isolated from the recent outbreaks in California, Mexico and Texas.

Shares of the company were trading up 5 percent at $4.48 Thursday before the bell. They had closed at $4.26 Wednesday on Nasdaq.

    <body>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The very first doses of swine flu vaccine will start arriving in states and cities that ordered it on Tuesday, and might be sprayed up the first patients&apos; noses by the end of the week, U.S. health officials said on Thursday.

Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the first U.S. H1N1 vaccine to be delivered will be 600,000 doses of a nasal spray made by MedImmune, a division of AstraZeneca.

&quot;This is a bit earlier than we were planning to get started,&quot; Schuchat said in a telephone briefing.

She said 25 states, counties or cities which had placed the first orders for H1N1 vaccine on Wednesday, would receive it on Tuesday and decide how to distribute it.

The nasal spray is only approved for people aged 2 to 49 who do not have asthma, but Schuchat said plenty of people could benefit from it anyway. The CDC is ordering flu vaccine from five makers and expects to get between 6 million and 7 million doses to its central U.S. distributor next week.

She said H1N1 pandemic flu was now widespread across the United States. &quot;What we are seeing is quite striking,&quot; she said.

While H1N1 is not any deadlier than seasonal flu, it is causing more severe disease among younger people than seasonal flu usually does, and could infect more people in the space of a few months.

PREGNANT WOMEN

Schuchat said 100 pregnant women had been hospitalized in intensive care with the virus and 28 had died. Pregnant women are at special risk from all forms of influenza.

&quot;As vaccine becomes available in appropriate formulations, we hope that pregnant women and their caregivers will take advantage of it,&quot; she said.

Immunization is considered to be the best method of preventing infection.

But once someone has the flu, the main treatment is the antiviral drug Tamiflu or oseltamivir, made by Roche AG under license from Gilead Sciences Inc.

She said the CDC had ordered 300,000 courses of liquid Tamiflu for children.

Some pharmacies had said they would start compounding liquid formulations for children because of reports of shortages of the pediatric formulation. Schuchat said even though the drug was past its stamped expiry date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved use of Tamiflu past this date.

&quot;So far each state that needs their proportion of that supply will receive this Tamiflu over the next week,&quot; Schuchat said.

&quot;People who have severe illness, who are hospitalized or have other warning signs can greatly benefit from antiviral medication,&quot; Schuchat added.

The CDC says most people will recover from H1N1 with no treatment but people who have trouble breathing, children who have trouble being awakened or who turn gray or blue, should all get immediate help.

The Trust for America&apos;s Health predicted on Thursday that 15 U.S. states cold run out of hospital beds if H1N1 infects just 35 percent of the population in coming weeks.

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The very first doses of swine flu vaccine will start arriving in states and cities that ordered it on Tuesday, and might be sprayed up the first patients&apos; noses by the end of the week, U.S. health officials said on Thursday.

Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the first U.S. H1N1 vaccine to be delivered will be 600,000 doses of a nasal spray made by MedImmune, a division of AstraZeneca (AZN.L).

&quot;This is a bit earlier than we were planning to get started,&quot; Schuchat said in a telephone briefing.

She said 25 states, counties or cities which had placed the first orders for H1N1 vaccine on Wednesday, would receive it on Tuesday and decide how to distribute it.

The nasal spray is only approved for people aged 2 to 49 who do not have asthma, but Schuchat said plenty of people could benefit from it anyway. The CDC is ordering flu vaccine from five makers and expects to get between 6 million and 7 million doses to its central U.S. distributor next week.

She said H1N1 pandemic flu was now widespread across the United States. &quot;What we are seeing is quite striking,&quot; she said.

While H1N1 is not any deadlier than seasonal flu, it is causing more severe disease among younger people than seasonal flu usually does, and could infect more people in the space of a few months.

PREGNANT WOMEN

Schuchat said 100 pregnant women had been hospitalized in intensive care with the virus and 28 had died. Pregnant women are at special risk from all forms of influenza.

&quot;As vaccine becomes available in appropriate formulations, we hope that pregnant women and their caregivers will take advantage of it,&quot; she said.

Immunization is considered to be the best method of preventing infection.

But once someone has the flu, the main treatment is the antiviral drug Tamiflu or oseltamivir, made by Roche AG (ROG.VX) under license from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O).

She said the CDC had ordered 300,000 courses of liquid Tamiflu for children.

Some pharmacies had said they would start compounding liquid formulations for children because of reports of shortages of the pediatric formulation. Schuchat said even though the drug was past its stamped expiry date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved use of Tamiflu past this date.

&quot;So far each state that needs their proportion of that supply will receive this Tamiflu over the next week,&quot; Schuchat said.

&quot;People who have severe illness, who are hospitalized or have other warning signs can greatly benefit from antiviral medication,&quot; Schuchat added.

The CDC says most people will recover from H1N1 with no treatment but people who have trouble breathing, children who have trouble being awakened or who turn gray or blue, should all get immediate help.

    <body>By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Children of women infected with influenza during pregnancy have a substantially higher risk of heart disease late in life, according to a study published on Wednesday.

The findings underscore the danger facing pregnant women from the H1N1 swine flu virus, or any other strain of flu, and also demonstrate that what happens in the womb can affect a person decades later.

Caleb Finch of the University of Southern California and colleagues studied records from the 1918 flu pandemic and found that boys whose mothers were infected during the second or third trimester of pregnancy with them had a 23 percent greater chance of having heart disease after age 60 than boys whose mothers were not infected.

Girls exposed in the second or third trimesters were not at greater risk for cardiovascular problems. But girls infected during the first trimester were 17 percent more likely than the general population have heart disease later in life.

Boys whose mothers had flu while pregnant were also more likely to be slightly shorter than their peers, Finch&apos;s team reported in the Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.

The researchers examined records of more than 100,000 people born around the time of the 1918 flu outbreak in the United States. They also examined the height of 2.7 million men born between 1915 and 1922, using military enrollment records from World War II.

Results showed that average height increased every successive year except for the period coinciding with fetal exposure to the flu pandemic.

Pregnant women are among the most vulnerable to severe complications from flu infection and have been moved to the front of the line for vaccines against the new H1N1 pandemic influenza virus.

But fewer than 25 percent of pregnant women get vaccinated for seasonal flu, according to government statistics. Health officials and groups representing doctors, nurses and other health advocates are urging that women who are pregnant get immunized against H1N1 and seasonal flu and contact their doctors if they start to develop symptoms.

&quot;The 1918 flu was far more lethal than any since. Nonetheless, there is particular concern for the current swine flu, which seems to target pregnant women,&quot; Finch said.

The H1N1 swine flu, which surfaced in North America in March, is a distant relative of the 1918 H1N1 strain that is estimated to have killed 50 million people and infected one-fifth of the world&apos;s population.

PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA)said tests on adults confirmed that a single dose of its vaccine against H1N1 flu was effective even for people aged over 65.

Sanofi Pasteur, the group&apos;s vaccines division, began clinical trials on Aug. 6 in the United States to test the performance and safety of its so-called Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine.

Data so far &quot;indicate that a single 15 mcg dose ... administered to adults, including the oldest study participants, induces a robust antibody response 21 days post-vaccination that is considered protective,&quot; Sanofi said in a statement on Thursday.

The study was carried out on 849 adults aged 18 and over. Interim data from clinical trials in children will be available in early October, Sanofi added.

The drugmaker said last week it expected its swine flu vaccine to boost revenue this year and next as it benefits from orders from governments to fight the virus. [ID:nLO170932]

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Fifteen states could run out of hospital beds and 12 more could fill 75 percent of their beds with swine flu sufferers if 35 percent of Americans catch the virus in coming weeks, a report released Thursday said.

The study, based on estimates from a computer model developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows the strain hospitals and health departments could face as a second wave of swine flu surges.

&quot;Our point in doing this is not to cry Chicken Little but really to point out the potential even a mild pandemic can have and how readily that can overwhelm the healthcare delivery system,&quot; Jeffrey Levi, director of Trust for America&apos;s Health, which sponsored the report, said in a telephone briefing.

According to the report, the number of people hospitalized could range from 168,025 in California to 2,485 in Wyoming, and many states may face shortages of beds.

Some may need to cut back on hospitalizations for elective procedures.

&quot;States around the country will also have to figure out how to manage the influx of people in doctors&apos; offices and ambulatory care settings, in addition to the surge in hospitalizations,&quot; Levi said.

He said state and local health departments are scrambling to set up distribution systems for the H1N1 vaccine as it becomes available this month, but challenges remained.

&quot;These systems are untested, and glitches are sure to arise along the way,&quot; Levi said.

Local health authorities are especially worried about reaching young people, who traditionally are not vaccinated for flu, and minorities, who were harder hit by the swine flu in the spring.

While the federal government will pay for the vaccine itself, Levi said, it was not yet clear how the actual cost of giving the shot will be financed.

Although many public and private insurance plans have said they will cover it, others have not yet agreed.

&quot;This could become a huge burden for state and local health departments, or become a dangerous disincentive for people to get a vaccine,&quot; he said.

The 35 percent attack rate used in the report is based on the 1968 flu pandemic, which was considered mild. It assumes an outbreak would last around eight weeks.

Levi said the number was consistent with World Health Organization statements predicting that up to a third of the world&apos;s population will become sick with the new H1N1 virus that was declared a pandemic in June.

The President&apos;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology said in August that 1,8 million Americans may need to be hospitalized and around 30,000 could die, assuming a 30 percent infection rate.

CONTACT: Nicole Vesely, 301-827-6793

The committee will discuss a new drug application for Ferriprox (deferiprone) film-coated tablets and oral solution, manufactured by ApoPharma Inc. The proposed uses for the product are as an iron chelating agent, which is a drug that binds with iron in the body and helps to make elimination of iron easier, reducing iron build-up. There are two specific proposed uses of Ferriprox. One is the treatment of iron overload, or build-up in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder that necessitates frequent transfusion of normal blood which can lead to iron build-up due to the iron content in the blood a patient receives. The second proposed use is treatment of iron overload in patients with other transfusion-dependent anemias (other blood disorders that require frequent transfusions) for which the use of other iron chelating agents has been considered inappropriate.

    <body>By David Morgan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly two-thirds of U.S. parents say they will hold off having their children vaccinated against the H1N1 swine flu or will not get them immunized at all, according to a survey released on Wednesday.

The findings, published by Consumer Reports, underscore one of the main challenges facing the Obama administration as it readies a massive swine flu vaccination roll-out -- how to persuade the most vulnerable people to protect themselves against the new virus.

H1N1, which emerged last March and became a pandemic in June, puts children and young people at greater risk than the elderly for severe illness and death. Pregnant women and people with underlying medical problems such as lung disease or diabetes are at higher risk.

Consumer Reports, a magazine published by the nonprofit advocacy group Consumers Union, surveyed 1,502 adults by telephone from September 2-7.

It found that 50 percent of parents are delaying the vaccination decision, mainly because they were wary about whether the new H1N1 vaccine has been tested enough.

The same concerns were shared by 14 percent of parents who have ruled out vaccination altogether.

About 35 percent of adults surveyed said they would definitely have their children vaccinated, significantly higher than the 22 percent of 5- to 18-year-olds who are immunized in a typical year, according to federal statistics.

The survey also found 43 percent of parents were not too worried about their children contracting H1N1, while about the same number worried about other parents overreacting.

The poll has a 3 percentage point margin of error and was taken before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved new vaccines for the H1N1 virus.

IMMUNIZATION CAMPAIGN

Preliminary test results have since shown children respond to the new vaccine just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with those over age 10 needing a single dose but children under 9 needing two.

Consumer Reports said it recommends that people within high risk groups consider immunization when the vaccine starts to become available next month.

The U.S. government has ordered vaccine from MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Australia&apos;s CSL, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.

U.S. health officials, who say immunization provides the best protection against flu infection, warn that low vaccine demand could now have dire consequences.

The elderly are a prime target for seasonal flu strains that kill about 36,000 people during mild outbreaks. But officials warn that many of those deaths this season could be children aged 18 and under.

The Obama administration plans to begin distributing vaccine doses next week as part of an immunization campaign that should ramp up to over 250 million doses by the end of the year.

H1N1, currently the dominant flu strain, has infected millions of people in the United States, and in late summer, intensified strongly in the U.S. Southeast where the school year tends to begin early.

The U.S. government has ordered vaccine from MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

U.S. health officials, who say immunization provides the best protection against flu infection, warn that low vaccine demand could now have dire consequences.

The elderly are a prime target for seasonal flu strains that kill about 36,000 people during mild outbreaks. But officials warn that many of those deaths this season could be children aged 18 and under.

The Obama administration plans to begin distributing vaccine doses next week as part of an immunization campaign that should ramp up to over 250 million doses by the end of the year.

H1N1, currently the dominant flu strain, has infected millions of people in the United States, and in late summer, intensified strongly in the U.S. Southeast where the school year tends to begin early. (Editing by John O&apos;Callaghan)</body>

LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) expects to start shipping out its H1N1 vaccine next week to governments across Europe so that mass vaccinations against the virus can begin.

Governments and drugmakers have been scrambling for vaccines to combat the new H1N1 flu strain before a feared second wave of infection hits the northern hemisphere in the winter.

The world&apos;s second biggest pharmaceutical company said on Wednesday it will begin shipments of its Pandemrix vaccine from next week, after getting official clearance from the European Commission on Tuesday. [ID:nLT633058]

European officials also gave a green light to Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.VX) for its H1N1 shot Focetria.

* Shares up 9 pct

Sept 30 (Reuters) - Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech Ltd SVA.A said it received a second order for its H1N1 swine flu vaccine from the Chinese government for the national stockpiling plan, sending its shares up 9 percent.

Sinovac is required to produce an additional 3 million doses of the vaccine, Panflu.1, for the central government.

On Sept. 4, the company received an initial order for 3.3 million doses from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China.

Sinovac was the first company worldwide to complete clinical trials for a vaccine to treat the new strain of H1N1, commonly dubbed swine flu. [ID:nLI544899]

Shares of the company were up 62 cents at $8.55 in premarket trade. They closed at $7.93 Tuesday on the American Stock Exchange.

By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor

WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Many people who have died of H1N1 swine flu in the United States have also had bacterial infections, health officials reported on Wednesday.

A study of 77 patients who died of the new pandemic H1N1 virus showed 29 percent of them had so called bacterial co-infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.

About half of these had Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can be prevented with a vaccine, the CDC said. It said doctors may be missing these infections in people severely ill with flu.

The CDC has already reported that H1N1, declared a pandemic in June, has become more active as weather cools and schools reopened after summer breaks. Cases are reported in all 50 states and it is still circulating globally.

H1N1 is not any more deadly than seasonal influenza so far but it attacks a younger age group than seasonal flu does and because virtually the entire population lacks immunity, it can infect far more people at once than seasonal flu usually does.

&quot;The findings in this report indicate that, as during previous influenza pandemics, bacterial pneumonia is contributing to deaths associated with pandemic H1N1,&quot; the team of experts at the CDC and state health departments reported.

&quot;Our influenza season is off to a fast start and unfortunately there will be more cases of bacterial infections in people suffering from influenza,&quot; CDC epidemiologist Dr. Matthew Moore, who helped organize the study, added in a statement.

The report noted in previous pandemics -- in 1968, 1957 and 1918 -- many of the patients who died were also infected with S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus, which causes rheumatic fever and &quot;strep throat&quot;.

The CDC team noted that at first it did not appear that people who were seriously ill with swine flu or who died of it had secondary infections but doctors may have missed them.

&quot;Routine clinical tests used to identify bacterial infections among patients with pneumonia do not detect many of these infections,&quot; the CDC team reported.

Five of the patients who died, including a 9-year-old and an 11-year-old, had infections with the so-called superbug methicillin-resistant S. aureus or MRSA. None of the seven children who died had reported medical conditions that should put them at special risk of flu complications, although one was obese and one had Down syndrome.

The researchers cautioned that the patients whose cases were studied may not represent the nation as a whole. But like most of the victims of swine flu, they were young, with a median age of 31 and ranging from 2 months to 56 years.

Moore said people getting flu vaccinations should also ask about getting a pneumococcal vaccine.

Wyeth&apos;s WYE.N Prevnar is part of the routine series of immunizations that children should get, and Merck and Co. (MRK.N) makes a vaccine against so-called pneumococcal bacteria that is available for adults, mostly those over 65. Merck also makes an Hib vaccine, although there is no vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections or MRSA. (Editing by Bill Trott)</body>

    <body>PERTH, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Australia rolled out a nationwide vaccination drive for H1N1 influenza on Wednesday in a bid to arm itself against a possible outbreak of the disease.

Health Minister Nicola Roxon said 5.5 million doses of the vaccine have been delivered across the country, enough to vaccinate about 30 percent of the population, and two million doses each month will be made available until January.

The campaign is Australia&apos;s biggest mass vaccination and is estimated to cost over A$100 million ($87.95 million). Vaccinations will start with those most at risk in the pandemic, including health care workers, pregnant women and the chronically ill.

More than 4,600 Australians have been hospitalised and 172 people have died from H1N1 flu.

Australia has ordered 21 million does of the flu vaccine from pharmaceutical company CSL Ltd (CSL.AX)

Roxon urged Australians to vaccinate themselves and stressed that the vaccine was safe, although some people could have minor side effects, including mild nausea.

&quot;While the new H1N1 virus causes a mild illness in most people, it can have a devastating hard edge. It is important that people take this disease seriously and protect themselves and their families by getting vaccinated,&quot; Roxon said.

While the country is coming to the end of its regular flu season, Australia&apos;s chief medical officer has said that the virus was unpredictable, and could emerge throughout the summer with a possible second outbreak before the next flu season.

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen - Analysis

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A dearth of new products, new technologies and fresh commitments by governments scrambling to protect their populations from pandemic threats have lured U.S. drugmakers back into the flu vaccine business.

Three big U.S. pharmaceutical companies announced vaccine deals this week.

Johnson &amp; Johnson, the world&apos;s largest healthcare company by market value, spent $444 million to buy a stake in Dutch biotech company Crucell as part of a new push into influenza vaccine and drug development.

Abbott Laboratories Inc spent $6.6 billion to buy the drugs unit of Belgium&apos;s Solvay, including Solvay&apos;s Dutch cell-based flu vaccine production facility, which can make both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.

And Merck &amp; Co, already a vaccines powerhouse with its shingles and cervical cancer vaccines, got back into the U.S. flu market with a deal to distribute seasonal flu vaccine made by Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd.

Although analysts say the deals are more strategic than game-changing, collectively they have infectious diseases experts heaving a sigh of relief.

&quot;I am very pleased. For a while, a lot of vaccine manufactures simply disappeared,&quot; said Dr. Hildegund Ertl, who directs the vaccine centers at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia.

&quot;There was this attitude 20 years ago, &apos;Let&apos;s not worry about microbes. We&apos;ve conquered them. Let&apos;s focus on cancer.&apos; Then HIV came along. Then SARS came along. Then H5N1 (avian influenza) came along,&quot; she said.

Ertl said beginning with an outbreak of bird flu in Hong Kong in 1998, the United States and other governments started to offer grants to companies to develop new ways of making influenza vaccines.

That has continued with the current H1N1 swine flu pandemic that started in June. The U.S. government has committed $1.8 billion to companies to make a swine flu vaccine.

OUT TO GET US

&quot;I think it&apos;s finally sinking into politicians&apos; minds that maybe viruses and pathogens are out to get us and that our infrastructure has really gone to hell,&quot; Ertl said in a telephone interview.

&quot;We have very few vaccine manufacturers in this country,&quot; she said, noting that companies like Wyeth , which is being acquired by Pfizer, dropped out of the flu vaccine market in the United States in 2002 because of high manufacturing costs and commodity pricing.

Five companies make swine flu vaccine for the U.S. market, all ultimately owned outside the United States -- AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune unit, CSL, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Novartis AG and Sanofi-Aventis SA.

&quot;The government is now pitching in to try to get interest back, to have more manufacturers make vaccines,&quot; Ertl said.

Both Wyeth and Merck once made influenza vaccines in the United States using conventional egg-based technology.

&quot;They decided it wasn&apos;t worth it,&quot; said Dr. Robert Belshe, director of Saint Louis University&apos;s Center for Vaccine Development. &quot;But with new technologies and the rise in importance influenza vaccine, I think companies are revisiting that now.&quot;

For example, instead of chicken eggs, Solvay makes flu vaccine in cell culture, and Crucell is developing &quot;flu-mAb,&quot; an antibody treatment meant to provide protection from all influenza A strains as well as to treat patients who are already infected.

Belshe said the United States is on the verge of recommending that all U.S. citizens get a flu shot. &quot;We&apos;re at 270 million people who should get vaccinated. It&apos;s a big market. I think manufacturers are just now catching up.&quot;

John Sullivan, director of research and healthcare strategist at Leerink Swann, said all three deals reflect the fact that the pharmaceutical industry has too few products, but &quot;lots of cash and lots of cash flow.&quot;

But he said the deals do suggest a change in direction.

&quot;These deals indicate that infectious disease is perhaps moving up the list of what the managements of some big therapeutics companies care about,&quot; Sullivan said in a telephone interview.

He said the swine flu pandemic has made clear that governments are more willing to pay for products that protect their populations than before.

&quot;If you look at some emerging countries -- Brazil, India, China -- governments are perceiving healthcare as a good that they can provide to their people, and they increasingly have enough money to do it.&quot;

By Ransdell Pierson

NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA) said on Tuesday his company has begun U.S. shipments of its H1N1 swine flu vaccine ahead of schedule.

&quot;The first truck left today,&quot; Chris Viehbacher said in an interview. &quot;So we&apos;re actually ahead of schedule, probably a couple of weeks.&quot;

Swine flu was declared a pandemic in June and is spreading widely in most of the United States.

At least 46 U.S. children under 18 have died from the flu strain since April, when it was first detected in the United States. That has raised concerns about the potential threat of the swine flu virus because typically no U.S. children die from the flu before October.

Sanofi-Aventis, which has a contract to provide 75.3 million doses of its H1N1 vaccine to the U.S. government, is making all of its product at a new plant in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania.

Sanofi-Aventis said its first shipment is headed to a designated government distributor, but the Paris-based company declined to provide the location or other details.

The government hopes by the end of the year to acquire a total of 250 million doses from Sanofi and four other vaccine makers -- the MedImmune division of AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) and Novartis AG (NOVN.VX).

U.S. SAYS ALL VACCINE MAKERS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE

Gretchen Michael, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday said all five vaccine makers are ahead of schedule because the government gave them an early go-ahead to fill their vials and nasal sprayers.

&quot;Everybody is ahead in production and scheduling deliveries because we got clinical data on the vaccines earlier than we expected,&quot; and were therefore able to authorize completion of the production process, she said.

Although the government is providing the vaccine free of charge, stores, doctors and some insurance companies are likely to charge for administering it.

MedImmune on Tuesday said it had delivered 5 million does of its nasally inhaled H1N1 vaccine in the past week to McKesson Corp (MCK.N), which the U.S. government has designated to distribute vaccines made by all five companies.

McKesson is distributing the vaccine through 90,000 sites across the United States. Each state will get allocations based on population. Doctor&apos;s offices, clinics, hospitals, retailers and employers can also place orders.

MedImmune said it has already made enough vaccine to fulfill its government contract for 40 million doses. Its product is approved for people aged 2-49, but not recommended for those with certain underlying health problems, or who have a high risk of becoming severely ill if infected with the flu.

Sanofi is working around the clock to fulfill its larger contract, with 2,000 employees involved in production.

Viehbacher said the vaccine is being delivered ahead of schedule because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its new Pennsylvania facility &quot;on a timely basis&quot; and because the plant has produced good &quot;yields&quot; of the vaccine. The vaccine is grown in chicken eggs.

&quot;We&apos;re using something like 300,000 eggs a day to produce the vaccine, (from) farms that are all dedicated to this,&quot; Viehbacher said.

An older Sanofi-Aventis plant in Swiftwater, meanwhile, is producing supplies of seasonal flu vaccine, that will be available separately to patients, Viehbacher said.

Such regular flu shots are given each year to protect against strains of influenza most likely to appear and infect people in the fall and winter months.

Viehbacher said no other company currently makes influenza vaccines in the United States, although Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.VX) has plans to build such a plant in North Carolina in coming years.</body>

    <body>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Sanofi-Aventis SA said on Tuesday his company has begun U.S. shipments of its H1N1 swine flu vaccine ahead of schedule.

&quot;The first truck left today,&quot; Chris Viehbacher said in an interview. &quot;So we&apos;re actually ahead of schedule, probably a couple of weeks.&quot;

Sanofi-Aventis, which has a contract to provide 75.3 million doses of its H1N1 vaccine to the U.S. government, is making all of its product at a new plant in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania.

Sanofi-Aventis said its first shipment is headed to a designated government distributor, but the Paris-based company declined to provide the location or other details.

The government hopes by the end of the year to acquire a total of 250 million doses from Sanofi and four other vaccine makers -- the MedImmune division of AstraZeneca Plc, Australia&apos;s CSL Ltd, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Novartis AG.

    <body>Sept 28 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has urged Muslims who are unfit, such as the elderly, ill, pregnant women and children, to postpone pilgrimage to Mecca as part of efforts to prevent a large-scale spread of the H1N1 flu.

Following are Saudi measures to prevent a major outbreak at the annual haj in November when three million pilgrims from over 160 countries are expected to flock in to Mecca. Pilgrims can also do the minor pilgrimage, or umra, throughout the year.

- So far there have been over 3,500 confirmed cases of H1N1 cases in Saudi Arabia, which were mostly cured, according to local media. Around 26 have passed away.

- The haj airport terminal of the Red sea port city of Jeddah, the first stop for pilgrims arriving in Saudi Arabia, will be fitted with 20 thermal sensors to check pilgrims.

- Medical staff at the airport will increase by 20 percent from last year&apos;s haj season to 550 medical professionals including doctors, nurses, lab technicians and pharmacists.

- Authorities will set up health centres near airports in Jeddah and Medina, the second holy city, with the capacity to house up to 500 patients who will be sent there for treatment during the incubation period.

- The kingdom has ordered 10 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine, expected to be available in October. It will be mandatory for all pilgrims coming into Saudi Arabia.

- Saudi Arabia also increased its stock of Tamiflu by 20 percent, double the WHO recommendation for other countries, authorities said in July.

- The authorities have postponed starting the new school year for up to two weeks to train over 66,000 teachers on how to help prevent the spreading of the virus in schools. The education ministry will get five million doses of H1N1 vaccine for students.

    <body>RIYADH (Reuters) - Several Muslim countries have imposed restrictions on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia due to worries about a major outbreak of H1N1 flu.

EGYPT

The most populous Arab state has decided to restrict umra and haj pilgrims to those over 25 and under 65 years. Egypt also plans to inoculate pilgrims against the H1N1 virus.

TUNISIA

Tunisia has canceled trips to perform umra this year and imposed tight restrictions on travel for the haj, especially on children and elderly pilgrims. Tunisia&apos;s Ministry for Religious Affairs has also advised people to postpone making haj this year, citing concerns about the spread of the flu virus.

IRAQ

The Iraqi government prevented Iraqis from going to umra directly from Iraq during Ramadan because of swine flu. The same restriction will not be in place for haj -- only for sick people, pregnant women and people above 65 years of age.

Some Iraqis have gone anyway, traveling through other countries, said Sheikh Mohammed Taqi al-Mowla of the haj and umra commission.

IRAN

Shi&apos;ite Iran banned pilgrims from performing the umra during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.

MOROCCO

Morocco plans no restriction on travel for haj if the situation does not deteriorate in Saudi Arabia but has made it mandatory for its more than 30,000 pilgrims to get the anti-flu vaccine.

Authorities will allow them to travel to haj only when they have their passports stamped by health officials to prove their vaccination, officials said.

    <body>By Aaron Gray-Block and Ransdell Pierson

AMSTERDAM/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world&apos;s two largest diversified healthcare companies struck deals on Monday that will propel them into vaccines, a red-hot area for investors because of the pandemic flu threat and potential high profits for preventing other diseases.

Jumping on the vaccines bandwagon, Abbott Laboratories agreed to buy the drugs unit of Belgium&apos;s Solvay in a $6.6 billion (4.5 billion euro) cash deal.

Abbott will gain Solvay&apos;s Dutch cell-based flu vaccine production facility, which can produce both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. Flu vaccines last year brought Solvay $201 million (137 million euros), or 5 percent of its pharmaceutical sales, but the new facility is expected to boost potential output and demand for the products.

The deal also gives Abbott a slate of Solvay medicines, including cholesterol drugs the companies now co-market, and expands its reach into Russia and other emerging markets.

Johnson &amp; Johnson, the world&apos;s largest healthcare company by market value, bought an 18 percent stake in Dutch biotech company Crucell for $444 million (302 million euros) as part of a flu vaccine development deal, Crucell said.

Vaccine-makers have been desirable M&amp;A targets recently, particularly for large drugmakers eager to secure new products as exclusivity on existing best-selling products nears an end.

Vaccines can be complicated to manufacture and therefore less vulnerable to eventual generic competition.

Recent advances in preventing diseases as diverse as cancer and flu have taken vaccines beyond their traditional marketplace for babies and established immunization as an option for adolescents, adults and the elderly.

Fears of a pandemic form of the H1N1 swine flu have intensified urgency to develop vaccines.

Merck &amp; Co, already a major player in vaccines, agreed with CSL Ltd to distribute the Australian company&apos;s seasonal flu vaccine in the United States for an undisclosed amount.

GlaxoSmithKline sealed a $2.2 billion deal on Monday with Brazil guaranteeing sales of its pneumococcal vaccine for 10 years, demonstrating how vaccines can help drugmakers gain ground in important emerging markets.

NO FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS

Abbott expressed optimism the Solvay deal could bolster profits over the next two years beyond its own forecast, helping lift company shares 3.3 percent to $48.89.

&quot;This is a great use for the assets and a heck of a good return,&quot; Abbott Chief Executive Miles White said on a conference call with analysts. White said Abbott is not &quot;financially constrained at all&quot; in pursuing other deals.

Solvay shares were little changed, closing at 74.65 euros.

In chasing Solvay, Abbott trumped a bid from Swiss drugmaker Nycomed, people familiar with the matter said.

Abbott said the deal should add 10 cents to ongoing earnings per share in 2010, doubling to more than 20 cents by 2012 and increasing thereafter.

Abbott had been reviewing a potential Solvay deal for months and had little initial interest, but changed its mind over the summer after gaining a better understanding of Solvay&apos;s drugs and their sales potential, White said.

&quot;We did more homework and made the increased effort,&quot; said White, who has overseen four other deals this year. The Solvay transaction should help Abbott continue to deliver double-digit percentage earnings growth in coming years, he said.

A UNIVERSAL FLU APPROACH

J&amp;J&apos;s transaction with Crucell will focus on developing &quot;flu-mAb,&quot; a universal product meant to prevent infection with all influenza A strains as well as to treat patients who are already infected. The strains include seasonal flu and H1N1 swine flu strains, along with the H5N1, or avian, strain.

&quot;A universal antibody or vaccine that protects against a broad range of strains would be an important advance in helping ... control acute epidemic and pandemic outbreaks,&quot; said Paul Stoffels, head of pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Shares of Crucell fell 3.8 percent, as the sale of the stake to J&amp;J ignited worries that a speculated takeover of the company will not happen. J&amp;J shares were up 1.4 percent.

Crucell has previously been in takeover talks with U.S. drugmaker Wyeth, but discussions were broken off in January after Pfizer moved in to buy Wyeth.

Johnson &amp; Johnson expects the deal to decrease its 2009 earnings by 2 to 4 cents per share.

Crucell issued 14.6 million new Crucell shares to J&amp;J, which paid about a 30 percent premium based on the average price of Crucell shares in the past 35 days, or about 20.63 euros per share.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - U.S. diversified health care company Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) has bought an 18 percent stake in biotech firm Crucell (CRCL.AS)(CRXL.O) for 302 million euros ($444 million) as part of a flu vaccine development deal, the Dutch company said on Monday.

Vaccine-makers have been hot M&amp;A targets recently, particularly for large drugmakers keen to secure new products as exclusivity on existing best selling products nears an end.

Crucell had previously been in takeover talks with U.S. drugmaker Wyeth WYE.N, but talks were broken off in January after Pfizer (PFE.N) moved in to buy Wyeth.

Johnson &amp; Johnson and smaller rival Abbott (ABT.N) are already the most diversified of the large U.S. and European healthcare companies, but both continue to snap up more companies and products -- often at distressed prices due to the economic downturn.

Crucell said it issued 14.6 million new Crucell shares to Johnson &amp; Johnson, which paid about a 30 percent premium based on the average price of Crucell shares in the past 35 days. That led to a price per share of about 20.63 euros.

The transaction will have an estimated dilutive impact of $0.02 to $0.04 on Johnson &amp; Johnson&apos;s 2009 adjusted earnings per share.

Crucell said the collaboration will focus on developing a universal &quot;flu-mAb&quot; product targeting all influenza A strains. That includes H1N1 strains which cause seasonal flu and the current pandemic flu, along with the H5N1, or avian, strain.

Both companies also agreed to milestones and royalty payments based on the successful development and commercialization of products, but Crucell declined to provide further details.

&quot;A universal antibody or vaccine that protects against a broad range of strains would be an important advance in helping ... control acute epidemic and pandemic outbreaks,&quot; said Paul Stoffels, global head of pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Johnson &amp; Johnson, in a statement.

Shares in Crucell were up 4 percent at 16.585 euros at 0750 GMT (3:50 a.m. EDT), outperforming a 1.1 percent fall in the Amsterdam midcap index .AMX.

&quot;This collaboration is a good deal for Crucell. Although the drug is still in a very early stage, Crucell would not have been able to support the expensive late clinical trials on its own,&quot; SNS Securities analyst Ilja Zaanen said.

The collaboration will also focus on development and commercialization of non-flu vaccines for the treatment and prevention of other infectious and non-infectious diseases.

As part of the deal, Crucell and Johnson &amp; Johnson affiliate JHC Nederland agreed to a three-year standstill, requiring Crucell&apos;s consent for an increase in JHC Nederland&apos;s interest in Crucell and a three-month lock-up on transfers of the shares.

Crucell Chief Executive Officer Ronald Brus said the deal will have no impact on the company&apos;s exclusive partnership with Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) over the French firm&apos;s production of a cell-based flu vaccine using Crucell&apos;s PER.C6 technology.

The company said last month it planned to kick off clinical Phase I studies of the experimental antibody-based flu drug, which had substantially outperformed Roche AG&apos;s (ROG.VX) market-leading Tamiflu pill in preclinical tests.

Brus said there were no changes to the company&apos;s timing, but declined to give an estimated date for the launch of a product.

&quot;We think we have a headstart. We have worked a long time already on this and we feel quite prepared to be the first out (with a product), but I can&apos;t give you timelines,&quot; Brus said.

Crucell&apos;s antibody, produced using its PER.C6 technology that uses human cells rather than chicken eggs, aims to provide an antibody to treat or prevent a wide variety of influenza viruses. Cell-based technology is thought to be more efficient than using eggs and offers greater production scale.

    <body>By Aaron Gray-Block

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - U.S. diversified health care company Johnson &amp; Johnson has bought an 18 percent stake in biotech firm Crucell for 302 million euros ($444 million) as part of a flu vaccine development deal, the Dutch company said on Monday.

Vaccine-makers have been hot M&amp;A targets recently, particularly for large drugmakers keen to secure new products as exclusivity on existing best selling products nears an end.

Crucell had previously been in takeover talks with U.S. drugmaker Wyeth, but talks were broken off in January after Pfizer moved in to buy Wyeth.

Johnson &amp; Johnson and smaller rival Abbott are already the most diversified of the large U.S. and European healthcare companies, but both continue to snap up more companies and products -- often at distressed prices due to the economic downturn.

Crucell said it issued 14.6 million new Crucell shares to Johnson &amp; Johnson, which paid about a 30 percent premium based on the average price of Crucell shares in the past 35 days. That led to a price per share of about 20.63 euros.

The transaction will have an estimated dilutive impact of $0.02 to $0.04 on Johnson &amp; Johnson&apos;s 2009 adjusted earnings per share.

Crucell said the collaboration will focus on developing a universal &quot;flu-mAb&quot; product targeting all influenza A strains. That includes H1N1 strains which cause seasonal flu and the current pandemic flu, along with the H5N1, or avian, strain.

Both companies also agreed to milestones and royalty payments based on the successful development and commercialization of products, but Crucell declined to provide further details.

&quot;A universal antibody or vaccine that protects against a broad range of strains would be an important advance in helping ... control acute epidemic and pandemic outbreaks,&quot; said Paul Stoffels, global head of pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Johnson &amp; Johnson, in a statement.

Shares in Crucell were up 4 percent at 16.585 euros at 0750 GMT, outperforming a 1.1 percent fall in the Amsterdam midcap index.

&quot;This collaboration is a good deal for Crucell. Although the drug is still in a very early stage, Crucell would not have been able to support the expensive late clinical trials on its own,&quot; SNS Securities analyst Ilja Zaanen said.

The collaboration will also focus on development and commercialization of non-flu vaccines for the treatment and prevention of other infectious and non-infectious diseases.

As part of the deal, Crucell and Johnson &amp; Johnson affiliate JHC Nederland agreed to a three-year standstill, requiring Crucell&apos;s consent for an increase in JHC Nederland&apos;s interest in Crucell and a three-month lock-up on transfers of the shares.

Crucell Chief Executive Officer Ronald Brus said the deal will have no impact on the company&apos;s exclusive partnership with Sanofi-Aventis over the French firm&apos;s production of a cell-based flu vaccine using Crucell&apos;s PER.C6 technology.

The company said last month it planned to kick off clinical Phase I studies of the experimental antibody-based flu drug, which had substantially outperformed Roche AG&apos;s market-leading Tamiflu pill in preclinical tests.

Brus said there were no changes to the company&apos;s timing, but declined to give an estimated date for the launch of a product.

&quot;We think we have a headstart. We have worked a long time already on this and we feel quite prepared to be the first out (with a product), but I can&apos;t give you timelines,&quot; Brus said.

Crucell&apos;s antibody, produced using its PER.C6 technology that uses human cells rather than chicken eggs, aims to provide an antibody to treat or prevent a wide variety of influenza viruses.

AMSTERDAM, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Dutch biotechnology firm Crucell (CRCL.AS)(CRXL.O) said on Monday Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) had bought 14.6 million new Crucell shares for 302 million euros ($443.5 million) as part of a flu vaccine development deal.

Crucell said the collaboration will focus on developing a universal &quot;flu-mAb&quot; product targeting all influenza A strains, including H1N1 strains which cause seasonal flu and the current pandemic flu along with the H5N1 or avian strain.

The newly-issued shares represent about 18 percent of Crucell&apos;s outstanding ordinary shares. Both companies also agreed to development milestones and royalty payments based on the successful development and commercialisation of products.

    <body>By Ulf Laessing

MECCA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Standing behind a wall of pearls and rosaries in a shop in Mecca, souvenir dealer Mohammad Hamdi says business has never been so bad.

Shops, hotels and tour operators in Islam&apos;s holiest city in western Saudi Arabia are counting the losses as many pilgrims, worried about a spread of swine flu, stay at home.

The haj, one of the world&apos;s biggest religious gatherings, is still two months away but there has already been a marked fall in visitors for the minor pilgrimage known as umra, which can be done at any time of the year.

&quot;In previous years people were buying a lot but now only a few come which is hitting sales,&quot; said Hamdi, from Egypt.

Losses in Mecca is small compared to the massive wealth of the kingdom which sits on more than a fifth of global oil reserves and billions of dollars in state coffers.

But the slump is plaguing a sector the government hopes to develop to help lower dependence on oil. Banks are also trying to cope with the debt problems of large family firms.

Faced with a mainly young native population of more than 18 million, job creation is a key challenge for the government.

Hotel occupancy rates during the last ten days of the fasting month of Ramadan, when many perform umra, fell by more than a third to 55 percent compared to last year, said Walid Abu Sabaa, head of the tourism and hotels committee at the Mecca chamber of commerce.

Countries such as Egypt, Tunisia and Iraq have sought to limit the number of pilgrims after Saudi Arabia urged the elderly and people with chronic diseases to postpone trips.

Businessmen say their biggest-spending clients are staying away. &quot;There is an absence of Gulf pilgrims from Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain or Oman,&quot; said Saudi jewelry dealer Saud Mohammad, who owns a store inside a mall.

PILGRIM TOURISM SUFFERS

Analysts differ on the exact fallout of the H1N1 virus on tourism but agree there will be a hit. &quot;Saudi authorities will be faced with serious health and economic challenges,&quot; said a report by Political Capital consultancy.

Despite hosting historical sights such as the Nabataean town of Madain Saleh, the kingdom has never become a tourist destination like neighbors Dubai or Bahrain, due to the austere Islamic rules dictating daily life and a tough visa regime.

Women must cover their hair and are not allowed to drive and unrelated men and women cannot mix. Alcohol, cinemas and bars are banned in the kingdom.

Tourism only contributed 2.7 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008, according to the central bank. The sector directly employs about 440,000 mostly expatriate workers.

The industry depends on domestic travel and pilgrims in Mecca and Medina -- both holy cities are witnessing massive investments to build hotels, malls or time-sharing apartments.

Authorities did not announce any deaths linked to flu in the two cities during Ramadan. In total, Saudi has treated around 3,500 cases of which 26 died, local media said.

The country plans new health centers and to import 10 million doses of vaccine.

Pharmacies in Mecca give masks worn by many pilgrims, police, shop and restaurant staff.

But even if the numbers go down authorities still face a big challenge -- thousands flock every day to the Grand Mosque with some poor pilgrims sleeping and dozing in groups on prayer mats. Workers promptly clean up the mosque, toilets and narrow streets but dustbins quickly fill up in central malls where many eat in cheap restaurants or on the ground.

&quot;I heard much of swine flu...(but) for an old woman like me there would be nothing better if I died here in this holy land,&quot; said a pilgrim in her 70s from Algeria.</body>

    <body>By Aaron Gray-Block and Ransdell Pierson

AMSTERDAM/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world&apos;s two largest diversified healthcare companies struck deals on Monday that will propel them into vaccines, a red-hot area for investors because of the pandemic flu threat and potential high profits for preventing other diseases.

Jumping on the vaccines bandwagon, Abbott Laboratories agreed to buy the drugs unit of Belgium&apos;s Solvay in a $6.6 billion (4.5 billion euro) cash deal.

Abbott will gain Solvay&apos;s Dutch cell-based flu vaccine production facility, which can produce both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. Flu vaccines last year brought Solvay $201 million (137 million euros), or 5 percent of its pharmaceutical sales, but the new facility is expected to boost potential output and demand for the products.

The deal also gives Abbott a slate of Solvay medicines, including cholesterol drugs the companies now co-market, and expands its reach into Russia and other emerging markets.

Johnson &amp; Johnson, the world&apos;s largest healthcare company by market value, bought an 18 percent stake in Dutch biotech company Crucell for $444 million (302 million euros) as part of a flu vaccine development deal, Crucell said.

Vaccine-makers have been desirable M&amp;A targets recently, particularly for large drugmakers eager to secure new products as exclusivity on existing best-selling products nears an end.

Vaccines can be complicated to manufacture and therefore less vulnerable to eventual generic competition.

Recent advances in preventing diseases as diverse as cancer and flu have taken vaccines beyond their traditional marketplace for babies and established immunization as an option for adolescents, adults and the elderly.

Fears of a pandemic form of the H1N1 swine flu have intensified urgency to develop vaccines.

Merck &amp; Co, already a major player in vaccines, agreed with CSL Ltd to distribute the Australian company&apos;s seasonal flu vaccine in the United States for an undisclosed amount.

GlaxoSmithKline sealed a $2.2 billion deal on Monday with Brazil guaranteeing sales of its pneumococcal vaccine for 10 years, demonstrating how vaccines can help drugmakers gain ground in important emerging markets.

NO FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS

Abbott expressed optimism the Solvay deal could bolster profits over the next two years beyond its own forecast, helping lift company shares 3.3 percent to $48.89.

&quot;This is a great use for the assets and a heck of a good return,&quot; Abbott Chief Executive Miles White said on a conference call with analysts. White said Abbott is not &quot;financially constrained at all&quot; in pursuing other deals.

Solvay shares were little changed, closing at 74.65 euros.

In chasing Solvay, Abbott trumped a bid from Swiss drugmaker Nycomed, people familiar with the matter said.

Abbott said the deal should add 10 cents to ongoing earnings per share in 2010, doubling to more than 20 cents by 2012 and increasing thereafter.

Abbott had been reviewing a potential Solvay deal for months and had little initial interest, but changed its mind over the summer after gaining a better understanding of Solvay&apos;s drugs and their sales potential, White said.

&quot;We did more homework and made the increased effort,&quot; said White, who has overseen four other deals this year. The Solvay transaction should help Abbott continue to deliver double-digit percentage earnings growth in coming years, he said.

A UNIVERSAL FLU APPROACH

J&amp;J&apos;s transaction with Crucell will focus on developing &quot;flu-mAb,&quot; a universal product meant to prevent infection with all influenza A strains as well as to treat patients who are already infected. The strains include seasonal flu and H1N1 swine flu strains, along with the H5N1, or avian, strain.

&quot;A universal antibody or vaccine that protects against a broad range of strains would be an important advance in helping ... control acute epidemic and pandemic outbreaks,&quot; said Paul Stoffels, head of pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Shares of Crucell fell 3.8 percent, as the sale of the stake to J&amp;J ignited worries that a speculated takeover of the company will not happen. J&amp;J shares were up 1.4 percent.

Crucell has previously been in takeover talks with U.S. drugmaker Wyeth, but discussions were broken off in January after Pfizer moved in to buy Wyeth.

Johnson &amp; Johnson expects the deal to decrease its 2009 earnings by 2 to 4 cents per share.

Crucell issued 14.6 million new Crucell shares to J&amp;J, which paid about a 30 percent premium based on the average price of Crucell shares in the past 35 days, or about 20.63 euros per share.

MECCA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Standing behind a wall of pearls and rosaries in a shop in Mecca, souvenir dealer Mohammad Hamdi says business has never been as bad.

Faced with a mainly young native population of more than 18 million, job creation is a key challenge for the government.

Hotel occupancy rates during the last ten days of the fasting month of Ramadan, when many perform umra, fell by more than a third to 55 percent compared to last year, said Walid Abu Sabaa, head of the tourism and hotels committee at the Mecca chamber of commerce.

Countries such as Egypt, Tunisia and Iraq have sought to limit the number of pilgrims after Saudi Arabia urged the elderly and people with chronic diseases to postpone trips.

Businessmen say their biggest-spending clients are staying away. &quot;There is an absence of Gulf pilgrims from Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain or Oman,&quot; said Saudi jewellery dealer Saud Mohammad, who owns a store inside a mall.

PILGRIM TOURISM SUFFERS

Analysts differ on the exact fallout of the H1N1 virus on tourism but agree there will be a hit. &quot;Saudi authorities will be faced with serious health and economic challenges,&quot; said a report by Political Capital consultancy.

Despite hosting historical sights such as the Nabataean town of Madain Saleh, the kingdom has never become a tourist destination like neighbours Dubai or Bahrain, due to the austere Islamic rules dictating daily life and a tough visa regime.

Women must cover their hair and are not allowed to drive and unrelated men and women cannot mix. Alcohol, cinemas and bars are banned in the kingdom.

Tourism only contributed 2.7 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008, according to the central bank. The sector directly employs about 440,000 mostly expatriate workers.

The industry depends on domestic travel and pilgrims in Mecca and Medina -- both holy cities are witnessing massive investments to build hotels, malls or time-sharing apartments.

Authorities did not announce any deaths linked to flu in the two cities during Ramadan. In total, Saudi has treated around 3,500 cases of which 26 died, local media said.

The country plans new health centers and to import 10 million doses of vaccine. Pharmacies in Mecca give masks worn by many pilgrims, police, shop and restaurant staff.

But even if the numbers go down authorities still face a big challenge -- thousands flock every day to the Grand Mosque with some poor pilgrims sleeping and dozing in groups on prayer mats. Workers promptly clean up the mosque, toilets and narrow streets but dustbins quickly fill up in central malls where many eat in cheap restaurants or on the ground.

&quot;I heard much of swine flu...(but) for an old woman like me there would be nothing better if I died here in this holy land,&quot; said a pilgrim in her 70s from Algeria.

LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - European healthcare regulators recommended two swine flu vaccines for approval on Friday, clearing the way for mass vaccination programmes to start imminently.

Governments and manufacturers have been scrambling for vaccines to target the new H1N1 flu strain, ahead of a feared second wave of infection as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) said its expert committee on new drugs gave the go-ahead for the first H1N1 swine flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX), called Pandemrix and Focetria.

The shots now only need final approval from European Commission, a move EMEA chief executive Thomas Lonngren said he expected to happen &quot;very rapidly ... hopefully next week&quot; as part of an accelerated regulation system for pandemic vaccines.

A third vaccine from Baxter (BAX.N), which had also been submitted under the fast-track &quot;mock-up&quot; procedure, did not get a green light, but the watchdog said it was still reviewing this and other applications.

A spokeswoman for Baxter said it expected to receive a positive opinion &quot;within days&quot;.

Shares in Glaxo rose 1.7 percent by 1350 GMT, buoyed by the European green light.

&quot;They weren&apos;t first out of the gate with the other players in the U.S. -- although they are confident of getting approval there -- so this has given them a bit of boost,&quot; said Navid Malik, an industry analyst at Matrix Corporate Capital.

Baxter stock added 1.2 percent, while Novartis was flat.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday that drugmakers will only be able to produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet -- around 3 billion doses per year -- meaning governments will have to decide who should get the limited supplies. [ID:nLO127713]

The WHO added that a single dose should be enough to give immunity to healthy adults and older children from the virus commonly known as swine flu, which was declared a pandemic in June.

TWO DOSES...FOR NOW

The EMEA, however, said it was currently recommending two doses be given, at an interval of three weeks, although it acknowledged preliminary data suggested one dose might suffice and this recommendation could be updated as new data comes in.

The London-based watchdog said it was confident the new vaccines were safe, despite being rushed through the approval process, adding manufacturers would have to carry out safety studies in 9,000 subjects for each vaccine after launch.

&quot;Decades of experience with seasonal influenza vaccines indicate that insertion of a new strain in a vaccine should not substantially affect the safety or level of protection offered,&quot; the agency said in a statement.

Both the Glaxo and Novartis shots contain adjuvants -- substances that enhance the immune response so that less active ingredient, or antigen, can be used in each dose.

Glaxo said its vaccine contained just 3.75 micrograms of antigen while the Novartis product contains 7.5 micrograms. That compares with 15 micrograms needed in non-adjuvanted vaccines.

Most rich nations have contracts with drugmakers to obtain enough vaccine to cover their populations and governments have already been building up stockpiles ahead of the shots winning regulatory approval.

But poorer countries lack the financial resources to compete for an early share of limited supplies.

Earlier this month, America&apos;s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved H1N1 flu vaccines from four drugmakers -- Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), CSL (CSL.AX), AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit and Novartis. [ID:nN1562056]

The WHO says it will begin an initial distribution of around 300 million doses of H1N1 vaccine donated by rich nations to more than 90 developing countries from November. (Additional reporting by Ben Deighton; Editing by David Cowell)</body>

    <body>By Robert Evans

GENEVA (Reuters) - Fresh donations of H1N1 vaccines are expected to swell a global stockpile created to ensure poorer nations have good supplies to contain the swine flu pandemic, a top United Nations health official said on Friday.

Dr. David Nabarro, the U.N. coordinator for fighting new emerging flu varieties, told reporters several richer states were likely to join nine which have agreed to share their own vaccines with developing countries.

&quot;It is most likely that there will be other countries donating 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine stocks,&quot; Nabarro said by telephone from New York during a break from meetings with already pledged and potential donors.

He declined to say who the new donors would be, indicating that announcements would be made by the countries themselves, probably after meetings he and other officials were holding with them on Friday and into the weekend.

Last week, vaccines were pledged to the U.N.-administered stockpile by Australia, Brazil, Britain, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United States.

Drug makers can only produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet, forcing each country to choose who will get the limited supplies, the WHO said on Thursday.

Mass vaccination programs could start in Europe within weeks after European healthcare regulators recommended two swine flu vaccines for approval on Friday.

Poorer nations are especially vulnerable to the H1N1 virus because many are badly affected by HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and have under-funded health services, U.N. and World Health Organization (WHO) officials say.

A report released earlier this week in advance of the New York meetings, chaired by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, said 85 developing countries would have to rely entirely on donations for vaccine supplies.

The Geneva-based WHO, which is coordinating the U.N. effort that involves several other agencies of the world body, aims to provide these nations with enough vaccine to cover 5-10 percent of their populations, the report added.

According to the report, based on responses from governments in the 85 developing states, poor countries will need $1.48 billion to deal with the pandemic over the next few years -- most of it in vaccines and antiviral medicines.

Nabarro said it would be up to governments in countries getting donations from the stockpile to decide what section of the population should have priority for vaccination.

But WHO officials are making clear they believe health care workers -- doctors, nurses and hospital and clinical staff who make up about two percent of the world population -- should be among the first to be immunized.

The U.N. health agency says it expects that one third of the world&apos;s nearly seven billion people could be infected by the virus over the course of the swine flu pandemic, which was declared in June and could last for three years.

As of September 20, swine flu had killed 3,917 people in 191 countries since being identified in April, the WHO said.

GENEVA, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Fresh donations of H1N1 vaccines are expected to swell a global stockpile created to ensure poorer nations have good supplies to contain the swine flu pandemic, a top United Nations health official said on Friday.

Dr. David Nabarro, the U.N. coordinator for fighting new emerging flu varieties, told reporters several richer states were likely to join nine which have agreed to share their own vaccines with developing countries.

&quot;It is most likely that there will be other countries donating 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine stocks,&quot; Nabarro said by telephone from New York during a break from meetings with already pledged and potential donors.

He declined to say who the new donors would be, indicating that announcements would be made by the countries themselves, probably after meetings he and other officials were holding with them on Friday and into the weekend.

Last week, vaccines were pledged to the U.N.-administered stockpile by Australia, Brazil, Britain, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United States.

Drug makers can only produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet, forcing each country to choose who will get the limited supplies, the WHO said on Thursday. [ID:nLO127713]

Mass vaccination programmes could start in Europe within weeks after European healthcare regulators recommended two swine flu vaccines for approval on Friday. [ID:nLJ445574]

Poorer nations are especially vulnerable to the H1N1 virus because many are badly affected by HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and have under-funded health services, U.N. and World Health Organisation (WHO) officials say.

A report released earlier this week in advance of the New York meetings, chaired by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, said 85 developing countries would have to rely entirely on donations for vaccine supplies.

The Geneva-based WHO, which is coordinating the U.N. effort that involves several other agencies of the world body, aims to provide these nations with enough vaccine to cover 5-10 percent of their populations, the report added.

According to the report, based on responses from governments in the 85 developing states, poor countries will need $1.48 billion to deal with the pandemic over the next few years -- most of it in vaccines and antiviral medicines.

Nabarro said it would be up to governments in countries getting donations from the stockpile to decide what section of the population should have priority for vaccination.

But WHO officials are making clear they believe health care workers -- doctors, nurses and hospital and clinical staff who make up about two percent of the world population -- should be among the first to be immunised.

The U.N. health agency says it expects that one third of the world&apos;s nearly seven billion people could be infected by the virus over the course of the swine flu pandemic, which was declared in June and could last for three years.

As of Sept. 20, swine flu had killed 3,917 people in 191 countries since being identified in April, the WHO said. (For the report go to link.reuters.com/wes28d ) (Editing by Jonathan Lynn and Michael Roddy)</body>

    <body>* Early treatment with antivirals effective in H1N1-WHO

* Vigilance against drug-resistance important

GENEVA, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Early use of antivirals is effective in treating H1N1 flu and health authorities must be vigilant for signs of drug resistance, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

Drug-resistant pandemic flu viruses have appeared infrequently so far and there is no evidence they are spreading, but further cases are likely, the WHO said on its website.

Growing international experience showed the importance of the early use of oseltamivir, manufactured as Tamiflu by Roche Holding (ROG.VX) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O), or zanamivir, an inhaled medicine produced as Relenza by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) in swine flu cases,&quot; the WHO said.

&quot;The experience of clinicians, including those who have treated severe cases of pandemic influenza, and national authorities, suggests that prompt administration of these drugs following symptom onset reduces the risk of complications and can also improve clinical outcome in patients with severe disease,&quot; the Geneva-based U.N. agency said.

&quot;This experience further underscores the need to protect the effectiveness of these drugs by minimising the occurrence and impact of drug resistance,&quot; it said.

Most people who contract pandemic influenza suffer only mild symptoms before recovery without treatment, but children, pregnant women and those with some existing health conditions are vulnerable to a more severe attack or even death.

The WHO, which declared H1N1 a global pandemic in June, says one third of the world&apos;s population of nearly seven billion people could catch it.

The risk of resistance is higher in patients who suffer from weak immune systems and have already been treated with oseltamivir, it said.

It is also high in people who are treated with the antivirals as a prophylactic -- as a precaution after exposure to someone with influenza, but nevertheless develop the disease.

In such cases medical staff should investigate whether resistance has developed and take precautions to prevent the spread of a resistant virus, it warned.

Health authorities should also investigate whether a drug-resistant virus is spreading through communities from person to person.

The WHO repeated guidance that it did not recommend taking antivirals as a prophylactic. People exposed to pandemic flu victims should be monitored closely and treated promptly with antivirals if symptoms develop, it said.

Global monitoring has detected 28 resistant viruses so far. In each case the viruses were resistant to treatment with oseltamivir but not zanamivir, which should be used to help patients suffering severe illness from an oseltamivir-resistant virus, it said.

By Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland

LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - European healthcare regulators recommended two swine flu vaccines for approval on Friday, clearing the way for mass vaccination programmes to start imminently.

Governments and manufacturers have been scrambling for vaccines to target the new H1N1 flu strain, ahead of a feared second wave of infection as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) said its expert committee on new drugs gave the go-ahead for the first H1N1 swine flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX), called Pandemrix and Focetria.

The shots now only need final approval from European Commission, a move EMEA chief executive Thomas Lonngren said he expected to happen &quot;very rapidly ... hopefully next week&quot; as part of an accelerated regulation system for pandemic vaccines.

A third vaccine from Baxter (BAX.N), which had also been submitted under the fast-track &quot;mock-up&quot; procedure, did not get a green light, but the watchdog said it was still reviewing this and other applications.

A spokeswoman for Baxter said it expected to receive a positive opinion &quot;within days&quot;.

Shares in Glaxo rose 1.7 percent by 1350 GMT, buoyed by the European green light.

&quot;They weren&apos;t first out of the gate with the other players in the U.S. -- although they are confident of getting approval there -- so this has given them a bit of boost,&quot; said Navid Malik, an industry analyst at Matrix Corporate Capital.

Baxter stock added 1.2 percent, while Novartis was flat.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday that drugmakers will only be able to produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet -- around 3 billion doses per year -- meaning governments will have to decide who should get the limited supplies. [ID:nLO127713]

The WHO added that a single dose should be enough to give immunity to healthy adults and older children from the virus commonly known as swine flu, which was declared a pandemic in June.

TWO DOSES...FOR NOW

The EMEA, however, said it was currently recommending two doses be given, at an interval of three weeks, although it acknowledged preliminary data suggested one dose might suffice and this recommendation could be updated as new data comes in.

The London-based watchdog said it was confident the new vaccines were safe, despite being rushed through the approval process, adding manufacturers would have to carry out safety studies in 9,000 subjects for each vaccine after launch.

&quot;Decades of experience with seasonal influenza vaccines indicate that insertion of a new strain in a vaccine should not substantially affect the safety or level of protection offered,&quot; the agency said in a statement.

Both the Glaxo and Novartis shots contain adjuvants -- substances that enhance the immune response so that less active ingredient, or antigen, can be used in each dose.

Glaxo said its vaccine contained just 3.75 micrograms of antigen while the Novartis product contains 7.5 micrograms. That compares with 15 micrograms needed in non-adjuvanted vaccines.

Most rich nations have contracts with drugmakers to obtain enough vaccine to cover their populations and governments have already been building up stockpiles ahead of the shots winning regulatory approval.

But poorer countries lack the financial resources to compete for an early share of limited supplies.

Earlier this month, America&apos;s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved H1N1 flu vaccines from four drugmakers -- Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), CSL (CSL.AX), AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit and Novartis. [ID:nN1562056]

The WHO says it will begin an initial distribution of around 300 million doses of H1N1 vaccine donated by rich nations to more than 90 developing countries from November. (Additional reporting by Ben Deighton; Editing by David Cowell)</body>

    <body>By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Three Canadian provinces have delayed their seasonal flu vaccination programs for most residents, citing unpublished studies that link the vaccine to H1N1 swine flu.

Preliminary Canadian research suggests people who have had seasonal flu shots could be at a greater risk of catching swine flu. However, federal health officials are skeptical, with Canada&apos;s top doctor saying on Friday that other countries have also studied the possible link and not made the same finding.

&quot;I&apos;m not worried about the seasonal vaccine,&quot; said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, adding, &quot;I think a lot more work needs to be done.&quot;

Health officials were examining the studies&apos; results, Butler-Jones said.

Researchers said this week that their preliminary studies, which have not been published or peer-reviewed, suggest people who had received a seasonal flu vaccine in the past were twice as likely to get the H1N1 virus, according to media reports.

Responsibility for seasonal flu vaccinations falls to the provinces, while the federal government has taken the lead against the H1N1 pandemic virus.

Butler-Jones said he personally will be getting both the seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines as soon as they&apos;re ready.

&quot;(A link between the two) is all speculative,&quot; he said.

On Thursday, Ontario became the first province to delay seasonal flu vaccines and will only provide those shots ahead of an H1N1 vaccination to people over 65, who are seen being at a higher risk.

Seasonal flu vaccine will be available to the rest of the province after the H1N1 flu vaccination, starting in November.

The provinces of Quebec and Saskatchewan took similar steps on Friday.

The H1N1 flu pandemic has killed 78 people in Canada.

    <body>BEIJING (Reuters Life!) - The autumn weather is glorious, a week-long holiday is coming up, but fears of the H1N1 flu are keeping many Chinese students in their dorms these days.

Schools in Xi&apos;an, a northwestern city that has seen heavy flu outbreaks, the port city of Tianjin and the northern province of Heilongjiang have shut temporarily to try and halt the spread of the virus, and the students are akin to prisoners.

The October 1 holiday is a week-long national vacation that normally sees Chinese streaming to scenic spots and historic sites, but this year, a lot of people are going nowhere.

The bars of the school gate separated Zhang Li, a senior at a university near Xi&apos;an, from her parents when they visited last week, bringing quilts for the colder weather.

The students at her school have been confined to campus since September 11, after one student came down with H1N1.

&quot;My parents came from quite a distance but they could only stand outside the school gate handing all the things they brought to me through the gate,&quot; Zhang said.

Zhang and her classmates may attend classes and sports events, but can only eat at campus cafeterias. Shuttles bring faculty and staff to the campus every day.

&quot;I have much more spare time now for movies and soap operas on TV,&quot; Zhang said.

China&apos;s Health Minister Chen Zhu warned this month that the beginning of the school year and the cooler weather could help the H1N1 virus spread more rapidly in China, which has not yet had a fatal case.

The numbers are climbing rapidly, with 14,581 cases reported as of Wednesday, of which 10,218 have recovered.

&quot;My friend studying in Xi&apos;an is complaining on QQ that she cannot go anywhere off campus, not to eat or even for a little walk,&quot; said Hu Die, a student who hails from Xi&apos;an, referring to a popular online chat program.

&quot;She had to stock up on dry provisions like biscuits and pies the last time she went shopping.&quot;

Even some students who aren&apos;t stuck in their dorms are taking the flu into account when making plans for the break.

&quot;My mom warned me against traveling when she called me recently. I will take H1N1 into account when considering where to go during the golden week,&quot; said Zhang Jing, a journalism graduate student at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

Other students are taking a more sanguine approach, like one senior, who declined to be named, from Tsinghua&apos;s department of Chinese language and literature who planned to take TOEFL courses during the one-week holiday to improve her English.

&quot;You will either be infected or you won&apos;t,&quot; she said, adding that there have been so many cases that seems pointless to worry.

&quot;Nothing can stop me if I really want a trip somewhere,&quot; her roommate echoed.

Students who want to go home for the break share her determination, even if their destination is hard-hit Xi&apos;an.

Long lines of students waited at ticket windows this weekend, proving to be a bigger obstacle than the threat of flu.

&quot;It&apos;s almost impossible to buy a train ticket during this period,&quot; said Zhao Yu, a senior at Tsinghua who doesn&apos;t plan to go anywhere for the break.

By Julie Goh

KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Shares of Malaysia&apos;s rubber glove makers have sky-rocketed since the outbreak of the H1N1 flu sent global demand for health-protection products soaring.

Higher average selling prices and lower latex costs provided an added boost, with Top Glove rising 103 percent so far this year, Supermax (SUPM.KL) up 219 percent, Kossan Rubber up 49 percent and Hartalega (HTHB.KL) up 200 percent.

As raw material costs start to rise and margins narrow with the weaker U.S. dollar, is it time to sell stocks of glove makers with valuations reaching unreasonable levels, or should investors continue to accumulate the shares?

BUY

&quot;We are positive on the sector,&quot; said Andrew Wong, who helps oversee assets worth $5.01 billion as AmInvestment Bank&apos;s chief investment officer for equity asset allocation.

&quot;If world demand is going to grow, whether it&apos;s because of the U.S. healthcare reform or H1N1, and people are more health-conscious, then there is a very good fundamental call on that,&quot; he said. &quot;We have Top Glove and Kossan. We&apos;re comfortable with their (fundamental) visibility and we&apos;re not selling (the shares),&quot; said Wong, who declined to say how much stock in the two glove manufacturers the bank is holding.

Affin Research analyst Wong May Pearl has an &quot;overweight&quot; stance on the sector based on her assumption of double-digit earnings growth in 2010.

Malaysia is the largest exporter and producer of medical rubber gloves, supplying 65 percent of the world&apos;s natural rubber and half of the world&apos;s nitrile gloves. Thailand and Indonesia account for most of the balance.

&quot;The rubber glove industry is one of the best performing sectors year-to-date,&quot; said Affin&apos;s Wong.

&quot;We believe current valuations are still undemanding. We expect glove players to register commendable double-digit earnings growth over the next few years at least, on the back of steady demand growth,&quot; she said.

Wong&apos;s top pick for the sector is Kossan, which she rates a &quot;buy&quot; with a target price of 6.05 ringgit.

According to Thomson Reuters data, 11 out of 14 analysts had &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;strong buy&quot; recommendations on Top Glove, the world&apos;s largest rubber glove manufacturer, while 10 out of 12 analysts had &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;strong buy&quot; ratings on sector laggard Kossan.

SELL

Some analysts say glove makers&apos; valuations have shot through the roof and most stocks are starting to look expensive.

&quot;If you look at Hartalega and Supermax, these stocks have gone up by 200 percent, which is beyond fundamental valuations,&quot; said Mohd Fauzi Mohd Tahir, head of equities at AmIslamic Funds Management, part of Malaysia&apos;s fifth-ranked AmInvestment Bank group.

&quot;It&apos;s tough to jusfify a buy on these stocks,&quot; he said.

According to Thomson Reuters data, Top Glove trades at 19 times its 2010 estimated earnings, Supermax trades at 11 times and Hartalega trades at 14 times.

The average PE for the food and household sector is 10.8 times earnings on Malaysia&apos;s benchmark index .KLSE, which is up 39 percent this year.

RHB Research, a member of the country&apos;s fourth-ranked RHB Banking group, puts Hartalega&apos;s fair value at 9.5 times its 2010 estimated earnings, said analyst David Chong, who has an &quot;underperform&quot; call on Hartalega. (Editing by Valerie Lee)</body>

    <body>By Robert Evans

GENEVA (Reuters) - Fresh donations of H1N1 vaccines are expected to swell a global stockpile created to ensure poorer nations have good supplies to contain the swine flu pandemic, a top United Nations health official said on Friday.

Dr. David Nabarro, the U.N. coordinator for fighting new emerging flu varieties, told reporters several richer states were likely to join nine which have agreed to share their own vaccines with developing countries.

&quot;It is most likely that there will be other countries donating 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine stocks,&quot; Nabarro said by telephone from New York during a break from meetings with already pledged and potential donors.

He declined to say who the new donors would be, indicating that announcements would be made by the countries themselves, probably after meetings he and other officials were holding with them on Friday and into the weekend.

Last week, vaccines were pledged to the U.N.-administered stockpile by Australia, Brazil, Britain, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United States.

Drug makers can only produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet, forcing each country to choose who will get the limited supplies, the WHO said on Thursday.

Mass vaccination programs could start in Europe within weeks after European healthcare regulators recommended two swine flu vaccines for approval on Friday.

Poorer nations are especially vulnerable to the H1N1 virus because many are badly affected by HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and have under-funded health services, U.N. and World Health Organization (WHO) officials say.

A report released earlier this week in advance of the New York meetings, chaired by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, said 85 developing countries would have to rely entirely on donations for vaccine supplies.

The Geneva-based WHO, which is coordinating the U.N. effort that involves several other agencies of the world body, aims to provide these nations with enough vaccine to cover 5-10 percent of their populations, the report added.

According to the report, based on responses from governments in the 85 developing states, poor countries will need $1.48 billion to deal with the pandemic over the next few years -- most of it in vaccines and antiviral medicines.

Nabarro said it would be up to governments in countries getting donations from the stockpile to decide what section of the population should have priority for vaccination.

But WHO officials are making clear they believe health care workers -- doctors, nurses and hospital and clinical staff who make up about two percent of the world population -- should be among the first to be immunized.

The U.N. health agency says it expects that one third of the world&apos;s nearly seven billion people could be infected by the virus over the course of the swine flu pandemic, which was declared in June and could last for three years.

As of September 20, swine flu had killed 3,917 people in 191 countries since being identified in April, the WHO said.

GENEVA, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Fresh donations of H1N1 vaccines are expected to swell a global stockpile created to ensure poorer nations have good supplies to contain the swine flu pandemic, a top United Nations health official said on Friday.

Dr. David Nabarro, the U.N. coordinator for fighting new emerging flu varieties, told reporters several richer states were likely to join nine which have agreed to share their own vaccines with developing countries.

&quot;It is most likely that there will be other countries donating 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine stocks,&quot; Nabarro said by telephone from New York during a break from meetings with already pledged and potential donors.

He declined to say who the new donors would be, indicating that announcements would be made by the countries themselves, probably after meetings he and other officials were holding with them on Friday and into the weekend.

Last week, vaccines were pledged to the U.N.-administered stockpile by Australia, Brazil, Britain, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United States.

Drug makers can only produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet, forcing each country to choose who will get the limited supplies, the WHO said on Thursday. [ID:nLO127713]

Mass vaccination programmes could start in Europe within weeks after European healthcare regulators recommended two swine flu vaccines for approval on Friday. [ID:nLJ445574]

Poorer nations are especially vulnerable to the H1N1 virus because many are badly affected by HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and have under-funded health services, U.N. and World Health Organisation (WHO) officials say.

A report released earlier this week in advance of the New York meetings, chaired by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, said 85 developing countries would have to rely entirely on donations for vaccine supplies.

The Geneva-based WHO, which is coordinating the U.N. effort that involves several other agencies of the world body, aims to provide these nations with enough vaccine to cover 5-10 percent of their populations, the report added.

According to the report, based on responses from governments in the 85 developing states, poor countries will need $1.48 billion to deal with the pandemic over the next few years -- most of it in vaccines and antiviral medicines.

Nabarro said it would be up to governments in countries getting donations from the stockpile to decide what section of the population should have priority for vaccination.

But WHO officials are making clear they believe health care workers -- doctors, nurses and hospital and clinical staff who make up about two percent of the world population -- should be among the first to be immunised.

The U.N. health agency says it expects that one third of the world&apos;s nearly seven billion people could be infected by the virus over the course of the swine flu pandemic, which was declared in June and could last for three years.

As of Sept. 20, swine flu had killed 3,917 people in 191 countries since being identified in April, the WHO said. (For the report go to link.reuters.com/wes28d ) (Editing by Jonathan Lynn and Michael Roddy)</body>

    <body>* Early treatment with antivirals effective in H1N1-WHO

* Vigilance against drug-resistance important

GENEVA, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Early use of antivirals is effective in treating H1N1 flu and health authorities must be vigilant for signs of drug resistance, the World Health Organisation said on Friday.

Drug-resistant pandemic flu viruses have appeared infrequently so far and there is no evidence they are spreading, but further cases are likely, the WHO said on its website.

Growing international experience showed the importance of the early use of oseltamivir, manufactured as Tamiflu by Roche Holding (ROG.VX) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O), or zanamivir, an inhaled medicine produced as Relenza by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) in swine flu cases,&quot; the WHO said.

&quot;The experience of clinicians, including those who have treated severe cases of pandemic influenza, and national authorities, suggests that prompt administration of these drugs following symptom onset reduces the risk of complications and can also improve clinical outcome in patients with severe disease,&quot; the Geneva-based U.N. agency said.

&quot;This experience further underscores the need to protect the effectiveness of these drugs by minimising the occurrence and impact of drug resistance,&quot; it said.

Most people who contract pandemic influenza suffer only mild symptoms before recovery without treatment, but children, pregnant women and those with some existing health conditions are vulnerable to a more severe attack or even death.

The WHO, which declared H1N1 a global pandemic in June, says one third of the world&apos;s population of nearly seven billion people could catch it.

The risk of resistance is higher in patients who suffer from weak immune systems and have already been treated with oseltamivir, it said.

It is also high in people who are treated with the antivirals as a prophylactic -- as a precaution after exposure to someone with influenza, but nevertheless develop the disease.

In such cases medical staff should investigate whether resistance has developed and take precautions to prevent the spread of a resistant virus, it warned.

Health authorities should also investigate whether a drug-resistant virus is spreading through communities from person to person.

The WHO repeated guidance that it did not recommend taking antivirals as a prophylactic. People exposed to pandemic flu victims should be monitored closely and treated promptly with antivirals if symptoms develop, it said.

Global monitoring has detected 28 resistant viruses so far. In each case the viruses were resistant to treatment with oseltamivir but not zanamivir, which should be used to help patients suffering severe illness from an oseltamivir-resistant virus, it said.

By Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland

LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - European healthcare regulators recommended two swine flu vaccines for approval on Friday, clearing the way for mass vaccination programmes to start imminently.

Governments and manufacturers have been scrambling for vaccines to target the new H1N1 flu strain, ahead of a feared second wave of infection as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) said its expert committee on new drugs gave the go-ahead for the first H1N1 swine flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX), called Pandemrix and Focetria.

The shots now only need final approval from European Commission, a move EMEA chief executive Thomas Lonngren said he expected to happen &quot;very rapidly ... hopefully next week&quot; as part of an accelerated regulation system for pandemic vaccines.

A third vaccine from Baxter (BAX.N), which had also been submitted under the fast-track &quot;mock-up&quot; procedure, did not get a green light, but the watchdog said it was still reviewing this and other applications.

A spokeswoman for Baxter said it expected to receive a positive opinion &quot;within days&quot;.

Shares in Glaxo rose 1.7 percent by 1350 GMT, buoyed by the European green light.

&quot;They weren&apos;t first out of the gate with the other players in the U.S. -- although they are confident of getting approval there -- so this has given them a bit of boost,&quot; said Navid Malik, an industry analyst at Matrix Corporate Capital.

Baxter stock added 1.2 percent, while Novartis was flat.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday that drugmakers will only be able to produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet -- around 3 billion doses per year -- meaning governments will have to decide who should get the limited supplies. [ID:nLO127713]

The WHO added that a single dose should be enough to give immunity to healthy adults and older children from the virus commonly known as swine flu, which was declared a pandemic in June.

TWO DOSES...FOR NOW

The EMEA, however, said it was currently recommending two doses be given, at an interval of three weeks, although it acknowledged preliminary data suggested one dose might suffice and this recommendation could be updated as new data comes in.

The London-based watchdog said it was confident the new vaccines were safe, despite being rushed through the approval process, adding manufacturers would have to carry out safety studies in 9,000 subjects for each vaccine after launch.

&quot;Decades of experience with seasonal influenza vaccines indicate that insertion of a new strain in a vaccine should not substantially affect the safety or level of protection offered,&quot; the agency said in a statement.

Both the Glaxo and Novartis shots contain adjuvants -- substances that enhance the immune response so that less active ingredient, or antigen, can be used in each dose.

Glaxo said its vaccine contained just 3.75 micrograms of antigen while the Novartis product contains 7.5 micrograms. That compares with 15 micrograms needed in non-adjuvanted vaccines.

Most rich nations have contracts with drugmakers to obtain enough vaccine to cover their populations and governments have already been building up stockpiles ahead of the shots winning regulatory approval.

But poorer countries lack the financial resources to compete for an early share of limited supplies.

Earlier this month, America&apos;s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved H1N1 flu vaccines from four drugmakers -- Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), CSL (CSL.AX), AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit and Novartis. [ID:nN1562056]

The WHO says it will begin an initial distribution of around 300 million doses of H1N1 vaccine donated by rich nations to more than 90 developing countries from November. (Additional reporting by Ben Deighton; Editing by David Cowell)</body>

    <body>By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Three Canadian provinces have delayed their seasonal flu vaccination programs for most residents, citing unpublished studies that link the vaccine to H1N1 swine flu.

Preliminary Canadian research suggests people who have had seasonal flu shots could be at a greater risk of catching swine flu. However, federal health officials are skeptical, with Canada&apos;s top doctor saying on Friday that other countries have also studied the possible link and not made the same finding.

&quot;I&apos;m not worried about the seasonal vaccine,&quot; said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada&apos;s chief public health officer, adding, &quot;I think a lot more work needs to be done.&quot;

Health officials were examining the studies&apos; results, Butler-Jones said.

Researchers said this week that their preliminary studies, which have not been published or peer-reviewed, suggest people who had received a seasonal flu vaccine in the past were twice as likely to get the H1N1 virus, according to media reports.

Responsibility for seasonal flu vaccinations falls to the provinces, while the federal government has taken the lead against the H1N1 pandemic virus.

Butler-Jones said he personally will be getting both the seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines as soon as they&apos;re ready.

&quot;(A link between the two) is all speculative,&quot; he said.

On Thursday, Ontario became the first province to delay seasonal flu vaccines and will only provide those shots ahead of an H1N1 vaccination to people over 65, who are seen being at a higher risk.

Seasonal flu vaccine will be available to the rest of the province after the H1N1 flu vaccination, starting in November.

The provinces of Quebec and Saskatchewan took similar steps on Friday.

The H1N1 flu pandemic has killed 78 people in Canada.

    <body>BEIJING (Reuters Life!) - The autumn weather is glorious, a week-long holiday is coming up, but fears of the H1N1 flu are keeping many Chinese students in their dorms these days.

Schools in Xi&apos;an, a northwestern city that has seen heavy flu outbreaks, the port city of Tianjin and the northern province of Heilongjiang have shut temporarily to try and halt the spread of the virus, and the students are akin to prisoners.

The October 1 holiday is a week-long national vacation that normally sees Chinese streaming to scenic spots and historic sites, but this year, a lot of people are going nowhere.

The bars of the school gate separated Zhang Li, a senior at a university near Xi&apos;an, from her parents when they visited last week, bringing quilts for the colder weather.

The students at her school have been confined to campus since September 11, after one student came down with H1N1.

&quot;My parents came from quite a distance but they could only stand outside the school gate handing all the things they brought to me through the gate,&quot; Zhang said.

Zhang and her classmates may attend classes and sports events, but can only eat at campus cafeterias. Shuttles bring faculty and staff to the campus every day.

&quot;I have much more spare time now for movies and soap operas on TV,&quot; Zhang said.

China&apos;s Health Minister Chen Zhu warned this month that the beginning of the school year and the cooler weather could help the H1N1 virus spread more rapidly in China, which has not yet had a fatal case.

The numbers are climbing rapidly, with 14,581 cases reported as of Wednesday, of which 10,218 have recovered.

&quot;My friend studying in Xi&apos;an is complaining on QQ that she cannot go anywhere off campus, not to eat or even for a little walk,&quot; said Hu Die, a student who hails from Xi&apos;an, referring to a popular online chat program.

&quot;She had to stock up on dry provisions like biscuits and pies the last time she went shopping.&quot;

Even some students who aren&apos;t stuck in their dorms are taking the flu into account when making plans for the break.

&quot;My mom warned me against traveling when she called me recently. I will take H1N1 into account when considering where to go during the golden week,&quot; said Zhang Jing, a journalism graduate student at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

Other students are taking a more sanguine approach, like one senior, who declined to be named, from Tsinghua&apos;s department of Chinese language and literature who planned to take TOEFL courses during the one-week holiday to improve her English.

&quot;You will either be infected or you won&apos;t,&quot; she said, adding that there have been so many cases that seems pointless to worry.

&quot;Nothing can stop me if I really want a trip somewhere,&quot; her roommate echoed.

Students who want to go home for the break share her determination, even if their destination is hard-hit Xi&apos;an.

Long lines of students waited at ticket windows this weekend, proving to be a bigger obstacle than the threat of flu.

&quot;It&apos;s almost impossible to buy a train ticket during this period,&quot; said Zhao Yu, a senior at Tsinghua who doesn&apos;t plan to go anywhere for the break.

(For more Reuters BUY OR SELLs, click [BUYSELL/])

By Julie Goh

KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Shares of Malaysia&apos;s rubber glove makers have sky-rocketed since the outbreak of the H1N1 flu sent global demand for health-protection products soaring.

Higher average selling prices and lower latex costs provided an added boost, with Top Glove rising 103 percent so far this year, Supermax (SUPM.KL) up 219 percent, Kossan Rubber up 49 percent and Hartalega (HTHB.KL) up 200 percent.

As raw material costs start to rise and margins narrow with the weaker U.S. dollar, is it time to sell stocks of glove makers with valuations reaching unreasonable levels, or should investors continue to accumulate the shares?

BUY

&quot;We are positive on the sector,&quot; said Andrew Wong, who helps oversee assets worth $5.01 billion as AmInvestment Bank&apos;s chief investment officer for equity asset allocation.

&quot;If world demand is going to grow, whether it&apos;s because of the U.S. healthcare reform or H1N1, and people are more health-conscious, then there is a very good fundamental call on that,&quot; he said. &quot;We have Top Glove and Kossan. We&apos;re comfortable with their (fundamental) visibility and we&apos;re not selling (the shares),&quot; said Wong, who declined to say how much stock in the two glove manufacturers the bank is holding.

Affin Research analyst Wong May Pearl has an &quot;overweight&quot; stance on the sector based on her assumption of double-digit earnings growth in 2010.

Malaysia is the largest exporter and producer of medical rubber gloves, supplying 65 percent of the world&apos;s natural rubber and half of the world&apos;s nitrile gloves. Thailand and Indonesia account for most of the balance.

&quot;The rubber glove industry is one of the best performing sectors year-to-date,&quot; said Affin&apos;s Wong.

&quot;We believe current valuations are still undemanding. We expect glove players to register commendable double-digit earnings growth over the next few years at least, on the back of steady demand growth,&quot; she said.

Wong&apos;s top pick for the sector is Kossan, which she rates a &quot;buy&quot; with a target price of 6.05 ringgit.

According to Thomson Reuters data, 11 out of 14 analysts had &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;strong buy&quot; recommendations on Top Glove, the world&apos;s largest rubber glove manufacturer, while 10 out of 12 analysts had &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;strong buy&quot; ratings on sector laggard Kossan.

SELL

Some analysts say glove makers&apos; valuations have shot through the roof and most stocks are starting to look expensive.

&quot;If you look at Hartalega and Supermax, these stocks have gone up by 200 percent, which is beyond fundamental valuations,&quot; said Mohd Fauzi Mohd Tahir, head of equities at AmIslamic Funds Management, part of Malaysia&apos;s fifth-ranked AmInvestment Bank group.

&quot;It&apos;s tough to jusfify a buy on these stocks,&quot; he said.

According to Thomson Reuters data, Top Glove trades at 19 times its 2010 estimated earnings, Supermax trades at 11 times and Hartalega trades at 14 times.

The average PE for the food and household sector is 10.8 times earnings on Malaysia&apos;s benchmark index .KLSE, which is up 39 percent this year.

RHB Research, a member of the country&apos;s fourth-ranked RHB Banking group, puts Hartalega&apos;s fair value at 9.5 times its 2010 estimated earnings, said analyst David Chong, who has an &quot;underperform&quot; call on Hartalega. (Editing by Valerie Lee)</body>

    <body>* Early arrival of swine flu vaccine creates dilemma

* CDC says swine flu now widespread in United States

By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - A top U.S. health official says the first weeks of October are going to be &quot;a little bumpy&quot; as the government distributes the supply the swine flu vaccine ready next week -- knowing it will not be enough.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Friday his agency faced a dilemma because most of the U.S. H1N1 vaccine will be unavailable until mid- to late October.

&quot;The choice was having vaccine stack up in a warehouse ... or getting it out as soon as it became available. We feel the only right answer is to get it out as rapidly as possible,&quot; Frieden told reporters in a telephone briefing.

But that move will add to the strain on state and local health departments that likely will have to turn people away.

&quot;It&apos;s going to be a little bumpy,&quot; said Frieden.

The U.S. government said this week it will have 6 million to 7 million doses of swine flu vaccine ready next week, and another 40 million does by mid- to late October. [ID:nN24456706]

Production was expected to continue at a rate of 10 million to 20 million doses per week to a total of more than 250 million by year end.

Most of the vaccine that will be ready early will be the nasal spray vaccine made by AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit. It is approved for people aged 2-49, but is not recommended for people with certain underlying health problems, who have a higher risk of becoming severely ill if infected with the flu.

&apos;BATCH BY BATCH&apos;

The United States has ordered vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Novartis (NOVN.VX).

Frieden said the problem arose from working with different manufacturers. &quot;It doesn&apos;t come out in one big drop. It comes out batch by batch,&quot; he said.

Frieden said vaccine was the best tool for fighting swine flu, which was declared a pandemic in June and is spreading widely in most of the United States.

Frieden urged Americans not to underestimate influenza, noting that many people mix up flu with mild respiratory viruses.

&quot;Flu makes you pretty sick. You feel bad. If you&apos;ve got an underlying health problem or you are unlucky, you can get very sick. You need to take the flu seriously,&quot; Frieden said.

Frieden addressed concerns about an unpublished study reported by Canadian media suggesting that people in Canada who were vaccinated against seasonal flu last spring had double the risk of becoming infected with pandemic H1N1 flu. [ID:nN24466530]

Frieden said the CDC has analyzed data from New York and other parts of the United States and data from Australia.

&quot;Nothing we&apos;ve seen suggest that is likely to be a problem,&quot; he said. &quot;If there is preliminary data, we&apos;d like to see it.&quot; (Editing by Maggie Fox and Xavier Briand)</body>

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A top U.S. health official says the first weeks of October are going to be &quot;a little bumpy&quot; as the government distributes the supply the swine flu vaccine ready next week -- knowing it will not be enough.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Friday his agency faced a dilemma because most of the U.S. H1N1 vaccine will be unavailable until mid- to late October.

&quot;The choice was having vaccine stack up in a warehouse ... or getting it out as soon as it became available. We feel the only right answer is to get it out as rapidly as possible,&quot; Frieden told reporters in a telephone briefing.

But that move will add to the strain on state and local health departments that likely will have to turn people away.

&quot;It&apos;s going to be a little bumpy,&quot; said Frieden.

The U.S. government said this week it will have 6 million to 7 million doses of swine flu vaccine ready next week, and another 40 million does by mid- to late October.

Production was expected to continue at a rate of 10 million to 20 million doses per week to a total of more than 250 million by year end.

* Pork production seen ample into next year

* Prices seen easing at the meat counter

(Updates throughout)

By Jerry Bieszk

CHICAGO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Financially stricken U.S. hog producers are cutting back on supply in a bid for profits but consumers will continue to get plentiful pork at grocery stores well into next year, analysts said on Friday.

&quot;Pork should continue to be a very good buy, especially in the fourth quarter,&quot; said Ron Plain, livestock economist at the University of Missouri. &quot;Normally pork is a good buy in the grocery store during the fourth quarter and that should be especially true here this year.&quot;

The country is awash in pork amid a slowdown in export demand due to the spread of the H1N1 flu, commonly referred to as swine flu despite the absence of evidence to show that the disease can be contracted through consumption of pork.

&quot;Exports are down so there is probably going to be more pork on the market in the fourth quarter of this year than there was a year ago,&quot; Plain said.

A U.S. Agriculture Department report on Friday said the U.S. hog herd as of Sept. 1 was down 2 percent from a year ago at 66.626 million head and the breeding herd was down 3 percent at 5.874 million head. But the number of pigs per litter was put at 102 percent of last year.

USDA earlier in the week put the total supply of pork sitting in U.S. warehouses at the end of August at 517.9 million lbs, a record for the month.

The average wholesale pork price reported by the USDA recently was the lowest in six years.

&quot;We are producing less meat and we are selling it at lower prices. That tells you the demand curve is going down. The demand for meat is less today than it was a year ago because of the recession,&quot; said Len Steiner, a principal at the food consulting firm Steiner Consulting.

But analysts noted that the speed at which pork moves off the grocery store shelves will depend on prices. With the slow economy, consumers are always looking for bargains.

&quot;There is plenty of pork around and consumers should benefit, assuming the retailers will lower the prices. There is no guarantee that they (retailers) are. They have good margins and are making good money on selling pork,&quot; said Dan Norcini, an independent hog trader.

&quot;I would like to see retailers lower prices on pork to get the domestic market moving better,&quot; Norcini said.

FEWER HOGS LATER AS PRODUCERS LOSE MONEY

Pork supplies may start to tighten sometime in late spring or early summer of next year as hog producers cut back further on the number of hogs produced.

Hog producers have been losing money for about two years, hurt initially by high feed and fuel costs. They continue to be hurt by a slowdown in pork sales as the recession hits restaurant sales and H1N1 flu curbs pork exports.

Two of the nation&apos;s largest hog producers, Smithfield Foods Inc (SFD.N) and Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) have reduced their hog herds, with Smithfield cutting its breeding herd by 13 percent.

But analysts believe smaller producers have not been as quick to pare herds. These producers may be hoping to benefit from higher prices after their neighbors quit or reduce production, analysts said.

The end result has been more hogs than expected and pork production has held at high levels, which has forced hog prices to be cut back severely from last year.

&quot;There will be an awful lot of red ink this fall and winter and well into spring. May is the first chance of a profitable month,&quot; for pork producers, Plain said. (Reporting by Jerry Bieszk; additional reporting by Bob Burgdorfer; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)</body>

* Drugmakers higher on GlaxoSmithKline vaccine approval * G20 in focus as leaders to keep stimulus in place

By Harpreet Bhal

LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Britain&apos;s top shares were higher at midday on Friday, lifted by strength in energy stocks as a pledge by world leaders to keep economic support in place settled investor nerves and lifted commodity prices.

By 1048 GMT, the FTSE 100 .FTSE was 0.4 percent, or 21.8 points higher at 5,101.07, gaining traction after finishing below 5,100 for the first time in a week on Thursday.

Oil and gas firms were the biggest gainers, as crude prices CLc1 regained ground above $66 a barrel after a 4 percent drop in the previous session. BG Group (BG.L), BP (BP.L), Cairn Energy (CNE.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) rose 0.4-1.6 percent.

Leaders of the Group of 20 major industrialised and developing countries pledged to keep emergency economic supports running until a durable recovery was secured, and work together when the time comes to remove them. [ID:nN25480100]

This helped remove anxiety that a removal of government stimulus would snuff out the nascent recovery which has helped lift the FTSE 100 48 percent since a six-year trough in March.

&quot;There is a pledge to keep the stimulus in place until we really see signs of recovery. That does help the market as all markets have been slightly rattled of late by the noises that the U.S. Fed have been making,&quot; said David Morrison, market strategist at GFT Global.

Weakness in the dollar is helping drive risk appetite for equities, while investors also look to a positive open on Wall Street for direction, he said.

&quot;To see the market above the 5,100 level is broadly bullish but we need to see it close above that for traders to think about it as being significant,&quot; he said.

Drugmakers were boosted by a 0.7 percent gain in GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) which rose after European healthcare regulators recommended the company&apos;s H1N1 swine flu vaccine for approval. [ID:nLJ445574]

AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Shire (SHP.L) were up 0.3 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.

Miners were broadly higher, lifted by higher metals prices which benefited as the dollar weakened on the G20 comments.

Anglo American (AAL.L), BHP Billiton (BLT.L), Lonmin (LMI.L) and Xstrata (XTA.L) rose 0.2-1.5 percent.

On the downside, Eurasian Natural Resources (ENRC.L) slipped 2.6 percent, after Central African Mining &amp; Exploration (CAMEC), (CFM.L) which has accepted a $955 million takeover from ENRC, swung to a full-year loss of $343 million. [ID:nLP398685]

Oil services firm in Petrofac (PFC.L) lost 2.7 percent after broker downgrades by Banc of America-Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs on a bearish outlook for the oil support services sector.

BANKS MIXED

Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) came under pressure, falling 2.3 percent as analysts cited the need for possible capital raising.

&quot;There&apos;s a lot of noise on rights issues to come ... and we&apos;re in a logical phase of consolidation after the very material gains since March,&quot; said Jonathan Lawlor head of European research at Fox-Pitt, Kelton.

Barclays (BARC.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) fell 1 and 0.7 percent respectively, while HSBC gained 1.2 percent after the lender was seen increasingly focusing on emerging markets. [ID:nLP422830]. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) was up 0.3 percent.

Defensive tobacco firms were also lower as appetite for riskier assets rose. British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Imperial Tobacco (IMT.L) shedding 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent respectively.

U.S. futures SPc1 pointed to a slightly higher open on Wall Street. Investors will keep an eye on data from across the Atlantic for further signs of the health of the U.S economy.

August durable good orders were due at 1230 GMT, the final September reading for the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index will be in focus at 1355 GMT and August new home sales will be eyed shortly after. (Editing by Dan Lalor)</body>

* Drugmakers higher on GlaxoSmithKline vaccine approval * G20 stimulus offsets disappointing U.S. data

By David Brett

LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Britain&apos;s top shares closed 0.1 percent higher on Friday, as strength in pharmaceutical and energy stocks offset falls in banks after investors drew confidence from the stimulus statements from the G20 conference.

The FTSE 100 .FTSE ended up 2.93 points at 5082.20, as the index ends the week lower for the first time since the end of August.

Leaders of the G20 pledged to keep emergency economic supports running until a durable recovery was secured. [ID:nN25480100].

The news saw investors shrug off disappointing durable goods data in the U.S., as orders tumbled 2.4 percent in August after rising 4.8 percent in July. [ID:nN25493668]

The G20 statement saw investors pile back into the U.S. dollar and Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin, believes that sterling saw weakness against both the dollar and euro may also be helping to keep upward momentum going.

&quot;A lot of the biggest FTSE 100 companies are big dollar and euro earners... and I think that has also helped support the upward movement today,&quot; Lenhoff said.

Oils were the biggest gainers, as Goldman Sachs predicted higher oil prices as demand recovers. Crude prices CLc1 regained ground above $66 a barrel after a 4 percent drop in the previous session.

BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSb.L) added 0.5 and 0.1 percent each.

Goldman Sachs also forecast a decline in production form companies, but expects BG Group (BG.L), up 1.7 percent, to be the exceptions.

Tullow Oil (TLW.L) was the top gainer, rising 3.2 percent, as the broker raised its target price to 1,396 pence from 1,160 pence.

Goldman Sachs also upped its target price on Cairn Energy (CNE.L), which climbed 1.5 percent, to 3,116 pence from 2,808 pence.

Drugmakers, prime examples of those companies with strong earnings in the U.S. and Europe were also among the top gainers. AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Shire (SHP.L) were up 0.2 and 1.6 percent respectively.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) climbed 1.8 percent after European healthcare regulators recommended the company&apos;s H1N1 swine flu vaccine for approval. [ID:nLJ445574]

Defensive tobacco firms were also higher with British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Imperial Tobacco (IMT.L) rising 0.2 percent each.

BANKS WAIN

UK banks extended recent falls as G20 leaders set out the groundwork for new banking rules. The group said banks must set aside more capital by the end of 2012 and showed agreement on the importance of reforming pay. [ID:nN2570471]

Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) came under pressure, falling 3.4 percent as analysts cited the need for possible capital raising.

&quot;There&apos;s a lot of noise on rights issues to come... and we&apos;re in a logical phase of consolidation after the very material gains since March,&quot; said Jonathan Lawlor head of European research at Fox-Pitt, Kelton.

Barclays (BARC.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) fell 2.1 and 1.5 percent respectively, while HSBC gained 0.1 percent after the lender said its CEO would move to Hong Kong as part of a increasing focus on emerging markets. [ID:nLP422830].

Oil services firm in Petrofac (PFC.L) lost 2.7 percent after broker downgrades by Banc of America-Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs on a bearish outlook for the oil support services sector.

By Dominic Lau

LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - European shares edged lower on Friday to hit a more than two-week closing low for a second day, led lower by weaker financials which outpaced gains in pharmaceutical and energy stocks.

The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 of top European shares closed 0.4 percent lower at 983.91 points in a choppy session, after trading between 990.43 and 982.12 points.

The index, which tumbled 1.9 percent to a two-week closing low on Thursday, was down 2.2 percent on the week.

Banks .SX7P, which have rallied 166 percent since March, were among the top losers as G20 leaders met in Pittsburgh for talks on possible tighter banking regulation. [ID:nLP422374]

Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), UBS (UBSN.VX), Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), Barclays (BARC.L) and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) were down between 0.4 and 3.4 percent.

Julius Baer (BAER.VX) shed 5.6 percent after giving disappointing targets in a strategy update and saying it would not increase dividends or buy back shares.

DnB NOR (DNBNOR.OL), however, soared 9.9 percent after Norway&apos;s biggest banking group announced a $2.4 billion rights issue to strengthen its capital position, with traders saying it removed some uncertainty.

New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell unexpectedly in August, dropping by their biggest margin in seven months, while sales of newly built U.S. single-family homes rose in August, short of expectations.

U.S. consumer sentiment, however, rose in late September to the highest since January 2008.

Leaders of the G20 pledged to keep emergency economic supports running until a durable recovery was secured. [ID:nN25480100]

&quot;The most compelling reason for buying equities is because the authorities continue to operate unusual policy. We are moving in the equity world into valuations probably above the long-term average,&quot; said Jim Reid, head of European equity strategy and global fundamental credit strategy at Deutsche Bank in London.

ABOVE AVERAGE

&quot;If they continue to put every measure, every stimulus into place, there is no reason why equities can&apos;t continue to trade above their long-term average, especially if bond yields stay very low.&quot;

Shares in European industrial engineering companies also lost ground, hit by demand concerns. Sulzer (SUN.S) fell 3.7 percent, Alstom (ALSO.PA) dropped 2.2 percent and ABB (ABBN.VX) lost 2.6 percent.

Around Europe, UK&apos;s FTSE 100 index .FTSE was up 0.1 percent, Germany&apos;s DAX index .GDAXI eased 0.4 percent and France&apos;s CAC 40 .FCHI lost 0.5 percent.

Volumes on the FTSEurofirst 300 were about 104 percent of the 90-day daily average.

Heavyweight oil &amp; gas firms lent some support to the pan-European index, as crude prices CLc1 rose above $66 a barrel on heightened tension between the West and Iran over Tehran&apos;s nuclear programme.

BP (BP.L), BG Group (BG.L), Tullow Oil (TLW.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L) put on 0.5 to 3.2 percent. Drugmakers were in favour, with Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) up 1.1 percent after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;underweight&quot; and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) up 1.8 percent.

European healthcare regulators said its expert committee on new drugs gave the go-ahead for the first H1N1 swine flu vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis (NOVN.VX), which added 0.4 percent.

Stock valuations are back at levels last seen in May 2006, with stocks in the FTSEurofirst 300 index trading at 13.6 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The FTSEurofirst 300, which has surged 53 percent since reaching a floor last March, is up 18.3 percent in 2009, although it is still down 40 percent from a multi-year-peak reached in mid-2007.

Citigroup said in a report the stage was set for some underperforming defensive stocks to rebound after the rally in cyclicals.

&quot;The rally over the last six months has anticipated the earnings turn. Cyclicals and financials have led. Performance then tends to broaden out into some of the defensives,&quot; it said.

&quot;The stage appears to be set for this broadening and a return of earnings momentum as a predictor of performance.&quot; (Additional reporting by Blaise Robinson; Editing by David Holmes)</body>

(Adds details, background)

LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Tamiflu can be given to babies less than six months of age during the current swine flu pandemic, Europe&apos;s medicines watchdog said on Friday.

The European Medicines Agency said its committee of experts had approved use of the Roche (ROG.VX) drug as a treatment for children under six months old and to prevent post-exposure infection in those under one year.

The World Health Organisation said earlier on Friday that early use of antivirals like Tamiflu was effective in treating H1N1 swine flu, though health authorities should be vigilant for signs of drug resistance. [ID:nLP93701]

Roche acquired rights to Tamiflu, or oseltamivir, from Gilead Sciences (GILD.O).

Most people who contract pandemic influenza suffer only mild symptoms before recovery without treatment, but children, pregnant women and those with some existing health conditions are vulnerable to a more severe attack or even death. (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by David Cowell)</body>

    <body>LONDON (Reuters) - Tamiflu can be given to babies less than six months of age during the current swine flu pandemic, Europe&apos;s medicines watchdog said on Friday.

The European Medicines Agency said its committee of experts had approved use of the Roche drug as a treatment for children under six months old and to prevent post-exposure infection in those under one year.

The World Health Organization said earlier on Friday that early use of antivirals like Tamiflu was effective in treating H1N1 swine flu, though health authorities should be vigilant for signs of drug resistance.

Roche acquired rights to Tamiflu, or oseltamivir, from Gilead Sciences.

Most people who contract pandemic influenza suffer only mild symptoms before recovery without treatment, but children, pregnant women and those with some existing health conditions are vulnerable to a more severe attack or even death.

    <body>By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Pharmacists may soon rekindle the traditional art of mixing medications as a shortage of liquid flu medicine leads them to crush capsules for young children and others who cannot swallow pills.

Pharmacists are taught to mix medications, a process known as compounding, in pharmacy school. While some pharmacists compound medications each day, such drugs now account for a small percentage of the millions of U.S. prescriptions filled each year.

&quot;Years ago this was the predominant way that medications were made,&quot; said Nimesh Jhaveri, executive director of pharmacy operations at Walgreen Co.

Now, at the start of what could be a major flu season, Roche has a limited supply of the liquid form of its flu symptom drug Tamiflu, or oseltamivir.

&quot;They had a significant amount of it ... waiting just in case we needed it, and all of that went out of date, essentially. So they&apos;re having to replace that supply,&quot; said Rod Shafer, a pharmacist and the chief executive of the International Association of Compounding Pharmacists.

The H1N1 swine flu became a pandemic in June and has already infected millions of people in the United States.

Tamiflu and rival drug Relenza, made by GlaxoSmithKline, can reduce the symptoms of flu, save the lives of patients with very severe symptoms and sometimes prevent influenza, all if taken early enough.

The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently advise saving the drugs for those most at risk of severe complications, such as pregnant women, people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and children with asthma.

Roche has advised pharmacies on how to compound capsules, which are in ready supply, into a liquid form.

&quot;It&apos;s not as simple as taking some capsules and throwing them in a liquid and giving it a shake,&quot; Shafer said.

LIQUID TAMIFLU STOCK DWINDLING

The supply of manufactured liquid Tamiflu is expected to come back shortly, so the chances of pharmacies actually having to do this are pretty small, Shafer said.

Still, drugstores are preparing. Walgreen, the largest U.S. chain, said it can rework the capsules to give patients the medication in liquid form at its more than 7,000 locations.

The active ingredients from the capsules must be combined with liquid, and pharmacists need to ensure that the ingredients are stable and keep their effectiveness.

&quot;Think of it as a recipe,&quot; said Walgreen&apos;s Jhaveri, himself a licensed pharmacist. &quot;This is truly the art of pharmacy.&quot;

The 15 to 20 minute process must be done each time a prescription needs to be filled. Pharmacies cannot make batches since that would be considered manufacturing, he said.

Walgreen still has the liquid version of Tamiflu in stock in the majority of its stores, but &quot;that stock is dwindling quickly,&quot; Jhaveri said. The biggest demand for Tamiflu has been seen in the Southeast, and supply is dwindling faster there.

&quot;We trying to be proactive, we know that this potentially could be a serious issue,&quot; Jhaveri said.

Liquid Tamiflu received a fresh dose of attention this week in a letter from doctors published in the New England Journal of Medicine. They advised that the dosage written in prescribing instructions does not always match up with the doses listed on the syringe used to dispense the product.

Roche sent a letter to healthcare professionals to remind them to follow the dosing instructions and make sure that the measurements match up on the prescription and the device used to give the medicine.

MOSCOW, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation on Thursday retracted a report of Russia&apos;s first known death from the H1N1 swine flu virus.

The WHO listed Russia on its www.who.int website on Wednesday as among 15 European countries that have registered deaths from the virus.

Russia was dropped from the list later on Thursday, with a footnote saying &quot;a death in the Russian Federation was mistakenly reported to be associated with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection.&quot;

The head of Moscow&apos;s Virology Institute, Dmitry Lvov, said this week a Russian woman had died from H1N1 after returning from Bulgaria, in what would have been the country&apos;s first known death from the virus.

Russian authorities said the statement was false. The 46-year-old woman in question had tested positive for H1N1 but had been suffering from kidney disease and died from pneumonia, they said.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Thursday quoted a Health Ministry official as saying the WHO had &quot;drawn conclusions purely on the basis of information distributed in the public sphere.&quot;

Russian authorities say they have registered 381 cases of H1N1, but Lvov told Russian television the actual figure could be in the tens of thousands, raising concern over the government&apos;s readiness to address the pandemic.

The WHO office in Moscow said the official in charge of covering H1N1 was not available for comment. (Reporting by Matt Robinson; Editing by Jon Hemming)</body>

(Recasts, adds quotes from Kieny teleconference)

By Stephanie Nebehay

GENEVA, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Drug makers can only produce enough H1N1 vaccine each year for half the planet and each country will have to decide who should get the limited supplies, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday.

The H1N1 vaccine looks to be as safe as the regular flu shot it said in a statement estimating that drug makers worldwide can produce an estimated 3 billion doses per year.

A single dose should be enough to give immunity to healthy adults and older children from the virus commonly known as swine flu, it said.

The WHO later said it was looking into an unpublished Canadian study indicating that a seasonal flu shot could increase the risk of catching the H1N1 virus. No other researchers had reported such findings, it said.

Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of WHO&apos;s initiative for vaccine research, said clinical trials had shown the vaccines being developed to be safe. Yields were better than previously thought though not quite as good as for seasonal flu.

&quot;Vaccine development is on track,&quot; Kieny told reporters, noting that China had begun immunising its population and Hungary was expected to follow suit next week.

&quot;These vaccine trials have given actually very good news. They have demonstrated that it is possible to reach a protective level of immunity with a single dose of vaccine, at least in most of the population,&quot; she said.

But drug companies had limited capacity to increase output to cover the planet&apos;s 6.8 billion population, according to the United Nations agency whose previous projection for global production capacity was close to 5 billion doses.

AS SAFE AS SEASONAL FLU SHOTS

&quot;Outcomes of trials completed to date suggest that pandemic vaccines are as safe as seasonal influenza vaccines,&quot; WHO said.

&quot;However, even very large clinical trials will not be able to identify possible rare events that can occur when pandemic vaccines are administered to many millions of people,&quot; it said.

Kieny said it was the responsibility of national health authorities to decide who gets the limited supplies, but said that vaccination programmes should not be mandatory.

&quot;The choice of population to be vaccinated is a national prerogative. Each country will have to take a decision in view of its own epidemiologic and national characteristics,&quot; she said.

However, the WHO strongly recommended that health care workers -- who make up an estimated two percent of the global population -- are vaccinated, she said.

The WHO advised countries to closely monitor the vaccine&apos;s safety and report &quot;adverse events&quot;. This was vital to determine whether changes in vaccination policies were needed.

Possible side effects are expected to be similar to those with seasonal flu vaccines, including soreness or swelling at the injection point and fever, headache, muscle or joint aches. These symptoms should be mild and last 1-2 days.

Most rich nations have contracts with drug makers to obtain enough vaccine to cover their entire populations, it said.

But most low- and middle-income countries lack the financial resources to compete for an early share of limited supplies, which in such countries would depend mainly on donations.

The WHO said it would begin an initial distribution of some 300 million doses of vaccine donated by rich nations to more than 90 developing countries from November.

Leading flu vaccine makers include Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis, Baxter, GlaxoSmithKline and Solvay. (Editing by Philippa Fletcher)</body>

    <body>GENEVA, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation said on Thursday it was looking into an unpublished Canadian study indicating that a seasonal flu shot could increase the risk of catching the H1N1 virus.

Marie-Paule Kieny, director of the WHO&apos;s initiative for vaccine research, said no other researchers had presented similar findings and it could be a &quot;study bias&quot;, although the Canadian investigators were well known and capable.

&quot;The reason why this may be different in Canada and in this particular study than in other places of the world is not yet identified. It may be a study bias, it may be that something is real,&quot; Kieny told a teleconference from the WHO headquarters.

She said all drug manufacturers who produced seasonal influenza shots will be able to make H1N1 vaccine, for a total annual output of 3 billion doses. Health workers, who make up 2 percent of the world&apos;s population, should be a priority. (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by Andrew Dobbie)</body>

Leading flu vaccine makers include Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), Novartis (NOVN.VX), Baxter (BAX.N), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Solvay (SOLB.BR).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health officials said on Thursday more than 6 million doses of H1N1 swine flu vaccine will be available the first week of October, twice as many as they expected only a week ago.

But even as officials ramp up vaccine production, they say most Americans tend not to bother getting vaccinated -- especially the children and young adults most at risk of being infected by the new H1N1 virus.

&quot;We really need to get the message out,&quot; U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters.

&quot;Taking the risk and getting sick is probably not a wise roll of the dice,&quot; she said. &quot;People can die, and the people who are going to be ill and die are much more likely to be children and young adults.&quot;

The U.S. government expects to have 6 million to 7 million doses of vaccine available the first week of October, up from an estimate of 3.4 million doses last week. Most of the early doses will be MedImmune&apos;s nose spray.

Another 40 million doses should be available in mid-October with production continuing at a rate of 10 million to 20 million doses per week to a total of more than 250 million by year end.

The United States has ordered vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune, a unit of AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Australia&apos;s CSL, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.

Meanwhile, hopes dimmed for the world vaccine supply on Thursday. The World Health Organization reduced its estimate of vaccine production capacity from 5 billion doses a year to 3 billion, enough for only half the planet.

HEALTH RISK

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated certain people to be vaccinated first. They include school-aged children, pregnant women and people with underlying conditions such as heart disease, asthma or diabetes.

At least 46 U.S. children under 18 have died from H1N1 swine flu infection since April, when the disease was first detected in the United States. Usually, between April and October, no U.S. children die from influenza.

H1N1 became a pandemic in June and has infected millions of people in the United States, the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said.

Sebelius said public reluctance to accept vaccination could itself pose a health risk.

She said that typically, fewer than 25 percent of children and pregnant women get vaccinated against seasonal flu, which kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people a year worldwide.

Vaccination rates are also below 30 percent for young adults and around 40 percent for healthcare workers.

An American Red Cross survey released last month showed that only 11 percent of Americans were very worried about the new swine flu while another 29 percent were somewhat worried. The rest -- 60 percent -- said they were not worried.

Swine flu is already widespread in 21 U.S. states. But the virus so far is proving to be milder than expected, with a death rate similar to that of seasonal flu.

Sebelius sought to emphasize the dangers swine flu poses for vulnerable groups by warning that many of the 36,000 deaths that occur in the United States during mild flu seasons could be children this time around.

&quot;We are not making this up. This is serious,&quot; she said. &quot;Parents need to understand.&quot;

So far, about 15 percent of children hospitalized for swine flu have required intensive care, Schuchat said.

Tests show the swine flu vaccine closely matches the H1N1 virus, which suggests it will protect people well. Children also respond to the vaccine just as they do the seasonal flu, meaning those over 10 need one shot while children 9 and under need two.

    <body>By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A study of rapid influenza tests found they miss many cases of swine flu and U.S. health experts said on Thursday they are not worth the trouble for this flu season.

A study looking at the effectiveness of a rapid flu test in the first few weeks of the H1N1 pandemic in May found it detected less than half of the cases later confirmed by more sophisticated tests.

The findings, which appeared in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s weekly report on death and disease, confirm the CDC&apos;s current guidelines, which stress that people with flu-like symptoms should get quick treatment, before getting a flu test.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters at a briefing that doctors should simply treat symptoms and not bother with testing.

&quot;The flu is the flu is the flu,&quot; she said.

In September, the CDC said doctors should not wait for laboratory confirmation of H1N1 because quick treatment is important, and because a negative rapid test does not rule out the flu.

The latest study, conducted by Dr. James Sabetta and colleagues at the Greenwich Hospital and the Greenwich Department of Health in Connecticut, shows why.

They collected data on patients from two school outbreaks of pandemic H1N1 flu in May. They did rapid flu diagnostic tests on 63 patients using the Xpect Flu A&amp;B test by Remel, a unit of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and more sophisticated lab tests.

They found the rapid flu test detected just 47 percent of the pandemic flu cases later confirmed by a slower, but highly accurate test called real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, or rRT-PCR, which checks for the genetic material of the virus.

The findings confirm an earlier study by the CDC that found quick flu tests caught just 40 to 69 percent of swine flu cases. That study, released in August, looked at three popular flu tests -- BinaxNow, made by Inverness Medical Innovations, Becton Dickinson&apos;s Directigen EZ Flu A+B test and Quidel&apos;s QuickVue.

The CDC said the findings confirm their current guidelines, and stress that treating flu -- whether seasonal or pandemic -- is more important than knowing what kind a person has.

&quot;Almost everybody will almost certainly not know what kind of flu they had,&quot; Dr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC told the briefing.

Many companies are working on better rapid tests including GlaxoSmithKline and Enigma Diagnostics, Seegene, a company based in South Korea and Maryland, DxNA based in Utah, and Osmetech PLC, based in California.

    <body>TOKYO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Japan&apos;s Nikkei stock average is
likely to slip on Friday after fears that authorities might be
curbing stimulus efforts too soon sent Wall Street lower, with
financials set to fall after Nomura Holdings (8604.T) said it
planned a large share offering. Nomura said it would raise up to $5.6 billion in its second
share sale since it bought the European and Asian operations of
Lehman Brothers, targeting investments and tighter capital
requirements. [ID:nT31071] Market analysts said the Nikkei was likely to follow Wall
Street lower, but that falls would be limited. &quot;There&apos;s definite signs that the world economy is on a
recovery path, and Japanese stocks are a bit behind other stock
markets at this point,&quot; said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at
the equity division of Nikko Cordial Securities. &quot;But the Nomura news is likely to weigh on banks and other
financials.&quot; World central banks said they would scale back infusions of
U.S. dollars into their banking systems, fuelling unease
triggered a day earlier when stocks sold off following the U.S.
Federal Reserve&apos;s decision to slow purchases of mortgage debt --
a key pillar of its efforts to support mortgage lending.
[ID:nLO239290] Tokyo market players said the impact of this, if any, would
be limited, but it pushed Wall Street lower, with the S&amp;P 500
.SPX hit by its worst two-day drop in three weeks as stocks
fell across the board. The benchmark Nikkei .N225 is likely to move between 10,300
and 10,550, market players said. It closed up 1.7 percent at
10,544.22 on Thursday, the first day of trade this week after a
string of holidays. In a sign the market is likely to open lower, Nikkei futures
traded in Chicago 2NKc1 lost 0.6 percent from the Osaka close
of 10,460 JNIc1.

    <body>* 2010 flu vaccines should contain pandemic H1N1 virus - WHO

* Too soon to say whether single or multiple shots needed

GENEVA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Vaccinations against flu for the 2010 influenza season in the southern hemisphere should also contain viruses against the current pandemic H1N1 virus, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday.

The WHO is currently coordinating the production of vaccines against pandemic H1N1, known as swine flu, for this year&apos;s influenza season in the northern hemisphere, which will start in November as the northern winter approaches.

But in early guidance to health authorities and vaccine makers, it said vaccines should contain the pandemic H1N1 virus plus two seasonal flu strains likely to circulate next year.

The WHO declared that swine flu was a global pandemic in June after it was detected in April.

&quot;Outbreaks subsequently occurred in all regions of the world and by July pandemic A (H1N1) was the predominant influenza virus circulating in many countries in the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania,&quot; it said in a note on its website.

It said it was too soon to say whether vaccines next year should comprise a single shot with all three viruses or whether there should be separate shots for pandemic and seasonal flu.

It said it would give guidance on this issue after its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, which makes recommendations on immunisation, considers the question in late October.

The pandemic H1N1 virus is becoming much more common than seasonal H1N1 strains that have also been circulating, it said.

The WHO has said the swine flu pandemic could affect one third of the world&apos;s nearly seven billion people. It is so infectious that most countries have stopped gathering statistics on how many people have caught it, but in the vast majority of cases so far the symptoms have been mild.

The WHO has said the swine flu pandemic could affect one third of the world&apos;s nearly seven billion people. It is so infectious that most countries have stopped gathering statistics on how many people have caught it, but in the vast majority of cases so far the symptoms have been mild.

    <body>DUBAI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates-based Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries (Julphar) GPHI.AD said on Wednesday it plans to start producing an H1N1 vaccine early next year. Julphar said in a statement on the Abu Dhabi bourse website it would start production after obtaining the technology and raw materials for the vaccine in January.

It said revenue from the vaccine&apos;s production would depend on demand, without giving further details.

Julphar said last week it had acquired exclusive rights to manufacture an H1N1 vaccine from China&apos;s Hualan Biological (002007.SZ). The company said it would seek to sell and market the single-shot vaccine, which has been approved by Chinese health authorities, in the Middle East and North Africa.

    <body>BEIJING, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The European Union&apos;s health chief expressed alarm on Wednesday at a Chinese plan to demand health certificates for pork imports, saying it was a form of protectionism, but China said it was needed to keep out flu.

The scheme, unveiled without fanfare last Friday, is designed to prevent the spread of the new H1N1 strain of flu -- sometimes known as swine flu -- by ensuring pork imports are free from the virus, according to the Chinese government.

But EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said the step, which would affect pork imports from countries including Britain, France and Denmark, is unjustified as the United Nations says pork cannot pass on the flu to humans. [ID:nL511530]

The EU fears it will impose too burdensome an extra cost on producers.

&quot;This will be of great concern to the EU because it&apos;s interpreted as protectionism,&quot; she told reporters in Beijing.

However, China produces almost all pork consumed in the country itself, so any impact on trade is likely to be limited.

China produced 44.59 million tonnes of pork in 2008, more than half the world&apos;s total. That same year, it imported just 1.92 million tonnes of pork and pork products.

Yu Taiwei, the head of China&apos;s quality watchdog&apos;s food safety export and import bureau, said the certification step was needed to prevent the spread of H1N1.

&quot;These countries can still export to China. We&apos;re not violating any agreements. We&apos;re not limiting imports,&quot; Yu said. (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Jerry Norton)</body>

By Jerry Bieszk

CHICAGO, Sept 23 (Reuters) - U.S. hog producers are cutting back their herds after a slide in futures prices to seven-year lows due to a supply glut, but further culling is needed to return them to profitability, analysts said.

&quot;They will lose money this month and should easily lose money for the rest of this year,&quot; said Ron Plain, livestock economist at the University of Missouri. &quot;I think they are going to have to wait until May 2010. That is the first shot that producers have of having a profitable month.&quot;

His comments come before the U.S. Agriculture Department&apos;s quarterly hogs and pigs report at 2 p.m. CDT (1900 GMT) on Friday.

Analysts differed on the severity of the cut in hog numbers the past three months, with estimates ranging widely from a 1 percent to 2.6 percent decline in the hog size. [USLIV/PIGS]

Feed costs have eased after the rally in corn and soybean futures to record highs last year, but the pork industry is still suffering from a drop in pork exports due to H1N1 flu, commonly called swine flu, cutting worldwide demand for pork.

The recession has also caused many consumers, both domestic and foreign, to reduce meat purchases.

Industry analysts noted that 21 of the last 23 months have been unprofitable for hog farmers.

&quot;The lack of producer profitability thus far this year suggests hog producers should be reducing the U.S. sow herd,&quot; said Erica Rosa of the Livestock Marketing Information Center.

Analysts on the high end of the estimates also noted that hog numbers may have been larger than the USDA estimated in the June report. This has shown up in the hog slaughter rate, which is running somewhat above projections.

BIGGER LITTERS ADD TO SUPPLY WOES

Producers also continuing to push for higher productivity, which adds to the number of pigs per litter.

&quot;The slaughter has been running a little bit high and USDA will need to revise up some of their numbers from the last report. We don&apos;t think there has been very much of a cutback in the sow breeding herd this summer and the productivity, we think, will be high,&quot; Plain said.

He said perfect weather conditions this summer may also have added to the number of hogs produced.

&quot;We had pigs per litter at 102.4 percent and part of the reason was a mild summer. Weather has been good so I think we are going to see a large pig crop out of it,&quot; he said.

The industry is hoping for a reduction in the breeding herd. Major producer Smithfield Foods Inc (SFD.N) said it would reduce its breeding herd by 13 percent.

This is the &quot;smallest Sept. 1 herd size in three years,&quot; said Joe Victor with Allendale Inc. &quot;Four quarters of liquidation have been in effect now.&quot;

But the industry on a whole has been slow to reduce the herd to numbers that would bring a profit. Analysts continued to look toward lenders, who are expected to pressure loss-making hog producers to cull their herds and help bring the industry back toward profitability.

&quot;I think bankers are starting to put pressure on and I think we will be seeing a bigger cut in winter farrowings than we will in the fall. My farrowings, fall intentions, were down only 2 percent and winter down 3 percent,&quot; Plain said. (Reporting by Jerry Bieszk; Editing by K.T. Arasu and Lisa Shumaker)</body>

    <body>BANGKOK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Thailand may see a 5 percent rise in tourist arrivals in the final quarter compared with a year before, after a sharp fall earlier this year, the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce said on Tuesday.

&quot;The sector should see a small improvement in the fourth quarter of this year and recover in the first quarter (of 2010),&quot; university economist Thanavath Phonvichai said, after a survey of 400 tourist operators conducted on Sept. 15-20.

Foreign arrivals are expected to fall about 10-15 percent in the third quarter after a 16-20 percent drop in the first half, Thanavath told a news conference.

For the whole of 2009, the industry expected the number of foreign tourists to fall to 12.5-13.0 million this year from last year&apos;s 14.5 million and revenue would fall by 10 percent from about 500 billion baht ($14.9 billion) last year, he said.

But in 2010, foreign arrivals are expected to rise to 14.5-15.0 million and revenue to increase to as much as 530 billion baht, Thanavath said, adding tourists from all markets should return to the &quot;Land of Smiles&quot;.

The global economic slowdown was the main factor discouraging people from travelling, while domestic political issues and the H1N1 flu were less worrying, Thanavath said.

&quot;Asian tourists should come back as well as those from Europe and the United States. If there is no political problem, arrivals should increase by 10-15 percent next year,&quot; he said.

Hotel operator Erawan Group ERAW.BK is also positive about prospects, saying earnings would turn round next year as long as political unrest was contained. [ID:nBKK490844].

By Deepa Seetharaman

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp &amp; Plc (CCL.N) (CCL.L) lifted its 2009 earnings forecast on Tuesday and said ticket prices for its cruises were stabilizing, boosting shares of the world&apos;s largest cruise operator as much as 9 percent.

Bookings for the next three quarters were 19 percent ahead of 2008 levels, spurred in part by heavy discounting. Travelers are also booking cruises earlier, which has helped rates stabilize, Carnival noted.

Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said during a call that rates were unlikely to fall further in the fourth quarter, given the strength of late bookings.

&quot;For a limited number of itineraries ... we have been able to move prices up,&quot; added Frank, who also acts as Carnival&apos;s vice chairman.

Frank said 2010 would likely be a stable year, but rising unemployment and the housing crisis remained major obstacles to a full recovery.

&quot;It is going to be a fairly stable environment, maybe slightly improving, but nothing more than that,&quot; he said.

Carnival expects to earn between $2.16 and $2.20 per share in 2009, an increase from its earlier range of $2.00 to $2.10. The company sees a 14 percent drop in net revenue yields, a key measure of revenue performance in the industry.

The company added that fuel prices would be higher than forecast in 2009, costing the company 5 cents per share. This would be partially offset by a weaker dollar, which would contribute 3 cents per share.

Shares of Miami-based Carnival spiked 7 percent to $34.27 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. Its main rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) (RCL.OL), saw its stock jump 4.1 percent to $24.20.

Carnival&apos;s credit default swaps tightened on Tuesday, meaning that it cost less to insure the company&apos;s debt against the risk of default than late last week, traders said.

THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS BEAT ESTIMATES

For the third quarter, ended Aug. 31, Carnival reported a net profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Revenue sank more than 14 percent to about $4.1 billion. Net revenue yields fell 16.4 percent, while costs, including fuel, fell 11.4 percent.

Carnival benefited from a 39 percent drop in fuel costs.

In the fourth quarter, Carnival expects earnings of 16 cents to 20 cents per share. On average, analysts expect 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Shares of Carnival, which are components of the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 indexes, have doubled since early March amid signs that economic recovery is under way.

In the third quarter, European cruises saw smaller declines in fares than North American offerings, said Bernstein Research analyst Janet Brashear in a note.

Europe is a major growth area for Carnival and the company plans to expand capacity there by 12 percent in 2010. Overall capacity is expected to jump 7.7 percent.

But Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said the outlook for close-in bookings remained murky, and rising fuel costs and a resurgence of the H1N1 flu could hurt results. During the call, Carnival said the flu reduced net revenue yields by 1.4 points in the third quarter.

&quot;We remain cautious on the cruise stocks given our view that the cruise industry&apos;s long-term risks are not going away (lack of pricing power due to oversupply and the fuel conundrum),&quot; wrote Kent, who has a &quot;sell&quot; rating on Carnival.

    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Influenza can help trigger heart attacks and may account for a 35 percent to 50 percent rise in heart attack deaths during flu season, British researchers reported on Monday.

While a flu vaccine can prevent these deaths, fewer than half of the most vulnerable heart patients in Britain actually get a flu vaccine every year, however, they said.

&quot;We believe influenza vaccination should be encouraged wherever indicated, especially in those people with existing cardiovascular disease,&quot; Charlotte Warren-Gash of University College London and colleagues wrote in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases.

&quot;Further evidence is needed on the effectiveness of influenza vaccines to reduce the risk of cardiac events in people without established vascular disease.&quot;

Warren-Gash and colleagues reviewed 39 studies conducted between 1932 and 2008 on the potential links between flu and heart deaths.

All the studies that covered entire populations showed a rise in deaths due to heart disease or heart attacks when influenza viruses were circulating, they found.

Seasonal influenza kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people a year, a figure that experts came up with by carefully monitoring confirmed flu deaths in a small area, counting excess deaths during influenza season over large populations, and consolidating both calculations.

Warren-Gash&apos;s team found the proportion of excess influenza deaths that were due to heart disease ranged from 35 percent to 50 percent.

Four out of eight studies showed people who were vaccinated from seasonal influenza were less likely to have a heart attack they found.

But in Britain, only 47 percent of people with chronic heart disease, asthma, diabetes or other conditions who are supposed to get a flu shot did last year.

Countries now are gearing up to vaccinate hundreds of millions of people against the pandemic H1N1 swine flu and people with chronic heart disease are at the top of the list of those who should get one.

By Jerry Bieszk

CHICAGO, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Pork supplies stored in U.S. warehouses in August set a record for the month, but analysts said the glut was not as big as expected amid signs that lower prices were drawing more consumers to buy the meat.

A government report showed that U.S. warehouses held 517.9 million lbs of frozen pork, exceeding last year&apos;s August record of 502.7 million lbs. It was the fourth consecutive record-setting month for pork stocks.

&quot;They (consumers) will still have adequate supplies lined up for the next two or three months. By our demand models they have actually been asking for pork so we haven&apos;t seen that switch out of pork back into beef yet,&quot; said Rich Nelson, analyst with Allendale Inc.

&quot;Yes, we still have record stocks for this month (August) and this is the fourth month in a row where we had record stocks, but the issue is that they weren&apos;t as big as anyone expected,&quot; he added. &quot;U.S. consumer demand, for all the tonnage we&apos;re shoving on them, is not doing too bad.&quot;

Analysts said pork stocks fell about 22 million lbs during August from July, steeper than the typical fall of about 4 million lbs for the month.

Traders expect Chicago Mercantile Exchange hog futures to open 0.100 to 0.200 cent per lb higher on Wednesday.

But the storage report may be quickly pushed aside by traders looking ahead to Friday&apos;s USDA quarterly hogs and pigs report, which usually has more impact on the futures market.

&quot;The cold storage report should have very little effect (on futures). You have record pork in storage and less than you thought - so does it have any real effect on the market - probably very little,&quot; said Jim Clarkson, livestock analyst with A&amp;A Trading Inc.

One reason for the buildup in pork stocks has been a slowdown in exports, despite weakness in the U.S. dollar amid a global recession. Exports are slow amid worries about H1N1 flu and because importing countries have been building their own hog and pork supplies.

China, the top pork buyer in 2008, now ranks third, with year-to-date purchases through July down 52 percent on a tonnage basis. Russia, another important market, has bought 29 percent less pork this year and South Korea 18 percent less.

Overall, year-to-date U.S. pork exports are down 10 percent, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.

Traders said exports of ham, however, have been better than expected amid demand from Mexico and Russia.

Belly stocks at 49.056 million lbs are the third largest on record for the end of August. Stocks were up from 3.9 million lbs last year and this could put some pressure on pork belly futures on Wednesday, analysts said.

&quot;It can be considered negative - we still have extra supplies,&quot; Nelson said. (Reporting by Jerry Bieszk; Editing by David Gregorio)</body>

    <title>Flu causes heart attacks but vaccine protects: study</title>

    <summary>... Countries now are gearing up to vaccinate hundreds of millions of people against the pandemic H1N1 swine flu and people with chronic heart disease are at the ...</summary>
    <body>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Influenza can help trigger heart attacks and may account for a 35 percent to 50 percent rise in heart attack deaths during flu season, British researchers reported on Monday.

While a flu vaccine can prevent these deaths, fewer than half of the most vulnerable heart patients in Britain actually get a flu vaccine every year, however, they said.

&quot;We believe influenza vaccination should be encouraged wherever indicated, especially in those people with existing cardiovascular disease,&quot; Charlotte Warren-Gash of University College London and colleagues wrote in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases.

&quot;Further evidence is needed on the effectiveness of influenza vaccines to reduce the risk of cardiac events in people without established vascular disease.&quot;

Warren-Gash and colleagues reviewed 39 studies conducted between 1932 and 2008 on the potential links between flu and heart deaths.

All the studies that covered entire populations showed a rise in deaths due to heart disease or heart attacks when influenza viruses were circulating, they found.

Seasonal influenza kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people a year, a figure that experts came up with by carefully monitoring confirmed flu deaths in a small area, counting excess deaths during influenza season over large populations, and consolidating both calculations.

Warren-Gash&apos;s team found the proportion of excess influenza deaths that were due to heart disease ranged from 35 percent to 50 percent.

Four out of eight studies showed people who were vaccinated from seasonal influenza were less likely to have a heart attack they found.

But in Britain, only 47 percent of people with chronic heart disease, asthma, diabetes or other conditions who are supposed to get a flu shot did last year.

Countries now are gearing up to vaccinate hundreds of millions of people against the pandemic H1N1 swine flu and people with chronic heart disease are at the top of the list of those who should get one.

* H1N1 vaccine affects people like seasonal flu vaccine (Adds MedImmune vaccine order 3rd paragraph)

By Maggie Fox

WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Younger children will need two doses of the vaccine against the new pandemic of H1N1 influenza, U.S. officials said on Monday.

They said tests of Sanofi-Pasteur&apos;s (SASY.PA) swine flu vaccine showed children respond to it just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with children over 10 needing only a single dose but children under 9 needing two.

Separately, Sanofi said it had won a U.S. government order for 27.3 million more doses of its vaccine and AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit said the U.S. government has ordered 29 million more doses of its needle-free vaccine. [ID:nN21284150]

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said young children will likely need to have their doses 21 days apart. But he said they could receive seasonal flu shots and H1N1 shots on the same day -- something that could ease the logistics of vaccinating children multiple times.

&quot;As we had hoped, in children the 2009 H1N1 vaccine is acting just like the seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Fauci told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Children aged 10 to 17 mounted an immune response that should protect them from H1N1 within 8 to 10 days, Fauci said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 46 U.S. children have died from swine flu, which appears to have first emerged in Mexico in March and which spread around the world to cause a pandemic in only six weeks.

As soon as the new virus was identified, the U.S. government and companies started making a vaccine against it and testing began in August to ensure it was safe and to determine what dose would be needed.

About 25 companies globally are now making H1N1 vaccine.

The United States had ordered 195 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi, Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), MedImmune and Novartis NOVN.AX. With the new orders from Sanofi and MedImmune, that would make more than 250 million doses.

MORE TO GO AROUND

Most countries ordered H1N1 vaccine with the expectation that two doses would be needed, so many now have more than anticipated.

The CDC has designated about 160 million people to be vaccinated first, including pregnant women, people with heart disease, asthma or diabetes and school-aged children.

With seasonal flu vaccine, children under 9 who are getting a flu vaccine for the first time need two doses, so Fauci said it is likely that young children who have never had a flu vaccine before will need four doses this year -- two seasonal flu doses and two swine flu doses.

But that may not mean four visits to a clinic or doctor&apos;s office, the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said. &quot;We do expect, based on what we know about vaccines, that it should be fine for the shot to be given on the same day,&quot; she said.

It gets a bit more complicated with MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray vaccine, she said. Children getting that needle-free vaccine will likely need to get FluMist, the seasonal version, separately from the swine flu formulated nose spray.

H1N1 is now the dominant strain of influenza circulating globally and Fauci said it is possible it may replace the seasonal form of H1N1 also circulating.

&quot;If you look at the history of where new viruses come in, frequently what they do is come back the next year and displace one or even more than one of the circulating strains,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a distinct possibility that this might ultimately be incorporated into a seasonal flu vaccine.&quot; (Additional reporting by David Morgan and Bill Berkrot, editing by Vicki Allen and Cynthia Osterman)</body>

By Deepa Seetharaman

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp &amp; Plc (CCL.N) (CCL.L) lifted its 2009 earnings forecast on Tuesday and said ticket prices for its cruises were stabilizing, boosting shares of the world&apos;s largest cruise operator as much as 9 percent.

Bookings for the next three quarters were 19 percent ahead of 2008 levels, spurred in part by heavy discounting. Travelers are also booking cruises earlier, which has helped rates stabilize, Carnival noted.

Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said during a call that rates were unlikely to fall further in the fourth quarter, given the strength of late bookings.

&quot;For a limited number of itineraries ... we have been able to move prices up,&quot; added Frank, who also acts as Carnival&apos;s vice chairman.

Frank said 2010 would likely be a stable year, but rising unemployment and the housing crisis remained major obstacles to a full recovery.

&quot;It is going to be a fairly stable environment, maybe slightly improving, but nothing more than that,&quot; he said.

Carnival expects to earn between $2.16 and $2.20 per share in 2009, an increase from its earlier range of $2.00 to $2.10. The company sees a 14 percent drop in net revenue yields, a key measure of revenue performance in the industry.

The company added that fuel prices would be higher than forecast in 2009, costing the company 5 cents per share. This would be partially offset by a weaker dollar, which would contribute 3 cents per share.

Shares of Miami-based Carnival spiked 7 percent to $34.27 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. Its main rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) (RCL.OL), saw its stock jump 4.1 percent to $24.20.

Carnival&apos;s credit default swaps tightened on Tuesday, meaning that it cost less to insure the company&apos;s debt against the risk of default than late last week, traders said.

THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS BEAT ESTIMATES

For the third quarter, ended Aug. 31, Carnival reported a net profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Revenue sank more than 14 percent to about $4.1 billion. Net revenue yields fell 16.4 percent, while costs, including fuel, fell 11.4 percent.

Carnival benefited from a 39 percent drop in fuel costs.

In the fourth quarter, Carnival expects earnings of 16 cents to 20 cents per share. On average, analysts expect 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Shares of Carnival, which are components of the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 indexes, have doubled since early March amid signs that economic recovery is under way.

In the third quarter, European cruises saw smaller declines in fares than North American offerings, said Bernstein Research analyst Janet Brashear in a note.

Europe is a major growth area for Carnival and the company plans to expand capacity there by 12 percent in 2010. Overall capacity is expected to jump 7.7 percent.

But Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said the outlook for close-in bookings remained murky, and rising fuel costs and a resurgence of the H1N1 flu could hurt results. During the call, Carnival said the flu reduced net revenue yields by 1.4 points in the third quarter.

&quot;We remain cautious on the cruise stocks given our view that the cruise industry&apos;s long-term risks are not going away (lack of pricing power due to oversupply and the fuel conundrum),&quot; wrote Kent, who has a &quot;sell&quot; rating on Carnival.

By Deepa Seetharaman

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp &amp; Plc (CCL.N) (CCL.L) lifted its 2009 earnings forecast on Tuesday and said ticket prices for its cruises were stabilizing, boosting shares of the world&apos;s largest cruise operator as much as 9 percent.

Bookings for the next three quarters were 19 percent ahead of 2008 levels, spurred in part by heavy discounting. Travelers are also booking cruises earlier, which has helped rates stabilize, Carnival noted.

Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said during a call that rates were unlikely to fall further in the fourth quarter, given the strength of late bookings.

&quot;For a limited number of itineraries ... we have been able to move prices up,&quot; added Frank, who also acts as Carnival&apos;s vice chairman.

Frank said 2010 would likely be a stable year, but rising unemployment and the housing crisis remained major obstacles to a full recovery.

&quot;It is going to be a fairly stable environment, maybe slightly improving, but nothing more than that,&quot; he said.

Carnival expects to earn between $2.16 and $2.20 per share in 2009, an increase from its earlier range of $2.00 to $2.10. The company sees a 14 percent drop in net revenue yields, a key measure of revenue performance in the industry.

The company added that fuel prices would be higher than forecast in 2009, costing the company 5 cents per share. This would be partially offset by a weaker dollar, which would contribute 3 cents per share.

Shares of Miami-based Carnival spiked 7 percent to $34.27 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. Its main rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) (RCL.OL), saw its stock jump 4.1 percent to $24.20.

Carnival&apos;s credit default swaps tightened on Tuesday, meaning that it cost less to insure the company&apos;s debt against the risk of default than late last week, traders said.

THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS BEAT ESTIMATES

For the third quarter, ended Aug. 31, Carnival reported a net profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Revenue sank more than 14 percent to about $4.1 billion. Net revenue yields fell 16.4 percent, while costs, including fuel, fell 11.4 percent.

Carnival benefited from a 39 percent drop in fuel costs.

In the fourth quarter, Carnival expects earnings of 16 cents to 20 cents per share. On average, analysts expect 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Shares of Carnival, which are components of the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 indexes, have doubled since early March amid signs that economic recovery is under way.

In the third quarter, European cruises saw smaller declines in fares than North American offerings, said Bernstein Research analyst Janet Brashear in a note.

Europe is a major growth area for Carnival and the company plans to expand capacity there by 12 percent in 2010. Overall capacity is expected to jump 7.7 percent.

But Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said the outlook for close-in bookings remained murky, and rising fuel costs and a resurgence of the H1N1 flu could hurt results. During the call, Carnival said the flu reduced net revenue yields by 1.4 points in the third quarter.

&quot;We remain cautious on the cruise stocks given our view that the cruise industry&apos;s long-term risks are not going away (lack of pricing power due to oversupply and the fuel conundrum),&quot; wrote Kent, who has a &quot;sell&quot; rating on Carnival.

    <body>* Children 10 to 17 need one dose of swine flu vaccine

* H1N1 vaccine affects people like seasonal flu vaccine (Adds MedImmune vaccine order 3rd paragraph)

By Maggie Fox

WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Younger children will need two doses of the vaccine against the new pandemic of H1N1 influenza, U.S. officials said on Monday.

They said tests of Sanofi-Pasteur&apos;s (SASY.PA) swine flu vaccine showed children respond to it just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with children over 10 needing only a single dose but children under 9 needing two.

Separately, Sanofi said it had won a U.S. government order for 27.3 million more doses of its vaccine and AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit said the U.S. government has ordered 29 million more doses of its needle-free vaccine. [ID:nN21284150]

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said young children will likely need to have their doses 21 days apart. But he said they could receive seasonal flu shots and H1N1 shots on the same day -- something that could ease the logistics of vaccinating children multiple times.

&quot;As we had hoped, in children the 2009 H1N1 vaccine is acting just like the seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Fauci told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Children aged 10 to 17 mounted an immune response that should protect them from H1N1 within 8 to 10 days, Fauci said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 46 U.S. children have died from swine flu, which appears to have first emerged in Mexico in March and which spread around the world to cause a pandemic in only six weeks.

As soon as the new virus was identified, the U.S. government and companies started making a vaccine against it and testing began in August to ensure it was safe and to determine what dose would be needed.

About 25 companies globally are now making H1N1 vaccine.

The United States had ordered 195 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi, Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), MedImmune and Novartis NOVN.AX. With the new orders from Sanofi and MedImmune, that would make more than 250 million doses.

MORE TO GO AROUND

Most countries ordered H1N1 vaccine with the expectation that two doses would be needed, so many now have more than anticipated.

The CDC has designated about 160 million people to be vaccinated first, including pregnant women, people with heart disease, asthma or diabetes and school-aged children.

With seasonal flu vaccine, children under 9 who are getting a flu vaccine for the first time need two doses, so Fauci said it is likely that young children who have never had a flu vaccine before will need four doses this year -- two seasonal flu doses and two swine flu doses.

But that may not mean four visits to a clinic or doctor&apos;s office, the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said. &quot;We do expect, based on what we know about vaccines, that it should be fine for the shot to be given on the same day,&quot; she said.

It gets a bit more complicated with MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray vaccine, she said. Children getting that needle-free vaccine will likely need to get FluMist, the seasonal version, separately from the swine flu formulated nose spray.

H1N1 is now the dominant strain of influenza circulating globally and Fauci said it is possible it may replace the seasonal form of H1N1 also circulating.

&quot;If you look at the history of where new viruses come in, frequently what they do is come back the next year and displace one or even more than one of the circulating strains,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a distinct possibility that this might ultimately be incorporated into a seasonal flu vaccine.&quot; (Additional reporting by David Morgan and Bill Berkrot, editing by Vicki Allen and Cynthia Osterman)</body>

But Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said the outlook for close-in bookings remained murky, and rising fuel costs and a resurgence of the H1N1 flu could hurt results. During the call, Carnival said the flu reduced net revenue yields by 1.4 points in the third quarter.

&quot;We remain cautious on the cruise stocks given our view that the cruise industry&apos;s long-term risks are not going away (lack of pricing power due to oversupply and the fuel conundrum),&quot; wrote Kent, who has a &quot;sell&quot; rating on Carnival.

* H1N1 vaccine affects people like seasonal flu vaccine (Adds MedImmune vaccine order 3rd paragraph)

By Maggie Fox

WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Younger children will need two doses of the vaccine against the new pandemic of H1N1 influenza, U.S. officials said on Monday.

They said tests of Sanofi-Pasteur&apos;s (SASY.PA) swine flu vaccine showed children respond to it just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with children over 10 needing only a single dose but children under 9 needing two.

Separately, Sanofi said it had won a U.S. government order for 27.3 million more doses of its vaccine and AstraZeneca&apos;s (AZN.L) MedImmune unit said the U.S. government has ordered 29 million more doses of its needle-free vaccine. [ID:nN21284150]

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said young children will likely need to have their doses 21 days apart. But he said they could receive seasonal flu shots and H1N1 shots on the same day -- something that could ease the logistics of vaccinating children multiple times.

&quot;As we had hoped, in children the 2009 H1N1 vaccine is acting just like the seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Fauci told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Children aged 10 to 17 mounted an immune response that should protect them from H1N1 within 8 to 10 days, Fauci said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 46 U.S. children have died from swine flu, which appears to have first emerged in Mexico in March and which spread around the world to cause a pandemic in only six weeks.

As soon as the new virus was identified, the U.S. government and companies started making a vaccine against it and testing began in August to ensure it was safe and to determine what dose would be needed.

About 25 companies globally are now making H1N1 vaccine.

The United States had ordered 195 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi, Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), MedImmune and Novartis NOVN.AX. With the new orders from Sanofi and MedImmune, that would make more than 250 million doses.

MORE TO GO AROUND

Most countries ordered H1N1 vaccine with the expectation that two doses would be needed, so many now have more than anticipated.

The CDC has designated about 160 million people to be vaccinated first, including pregnant women, people with heart disease, asthma or diabetes and school-aged children.

With seasonal flu vaccine, children under 9 who are getting a flu vaccine for the first time need two doses, so Fauci said it is likely that young children who have never had a flu vaccine before will need four doses this year -- two seasonal flu doses and two swine flu doses.

But that may not mean four visits to a clinic or doctor&apos;s office, the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said. &quot;We do expect, based on what we know about vaccines, that it should be fine for the shot to be given on the same day,&quot; she said.

It gets a bit more complicated with MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray vaccine, she said. Children getting that needle-free vaccine will likely need to get FluMist, the seasonal version, separately from the swine flu formulated nose spray.

H1N1 is now the dominant strain of influenza circulating globally and Fauci said it is possible it may replace the seasonal form of H1N1 also circulating.

&quot;If you look at the history of where new viruses come in, frequently what they do is come back the next year and displace one or even more than one of the circulating strains,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a distinct possibility that this might ultimately be incorporated into a seasonal flu vaccine.&quot; (Additional reporting by David Morgan and Bill Berkrot, editing by Vicki Allen and Cynthia Osterman)</body>

By Deepa Seetharaman

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp &amp; Plc (CCL.N) (CCL.L) lifted its 2009 earnings forecast on Tuesday and said ticket prices for its cruises were stabilizing, boosting shares of the world&apos;s largest cruise operator as much as 9 percent.

Bookings for the next three quarters were 19 percent ahead of 2008 levels, spurred in part by heavy discounting. Travelers are also booking cruises earlier, which has helped rates stabilize, Carnival noted.

Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said during a call that rates were unlikely to fall further in the fourth quarter, given the strength of late bookings.

&quot;For a limited number of itineraries ... we have been able to move prices up,&quot; added Frank, who also acts as Carnival&apos;s vice chairman.

Frank said 2010 would likely be a stable year, but rising unemployment and the housing crisis remained major obstacles to a full recovery.

&quot;It is going to be a fairly stable environment, maybe slightly improving, but nothing more than that,&quot; he said.

Carnival expects to earn between $2.16 and $2.20 per share in 2009, an increase from its earlier range of $2.00 to $2.10. The company sees a 14 percent drop in net revenue yields, a key measure of revenue performance in the industry.

The company added that fuel prices would be higher than forecast in 2009, costing the company 5 cents per share. This would be partially offset by a weaker dollar, which would contribute 3 cents per share.

Shares of Miami-based Carnival spiked 7 percent to $34.27 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. Its main rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) (RCL.OL), saw its stock jump 4.1 percent to $24.20.

Carnival&apos;s credit default swaps tightened on Tuesday, meaning that it cost less to insure the company&apos;s debt against the risk of default than late last week, traders said.

THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS BEAT ESTIMATES

For the third quarter, ended Aug. 31, Carnival reported a net profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Revenue sank more than 14 percent to about $4.1 billion. Net revenue yields fell 16.4 percent, while costs, including fuel, fell 11.4 percent.

Carnival benefited from a 39 percent drop in fuel costs.

In the fourth quarter, Carnival expects earnings of 16 cents to 20 cents per share. On average, analysts expect 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Shares of Carnival, which are components of the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 indexes, have doubled since early March amid signs that economic recovery is under way.

In the third quarter, European cruises saw smaller declines in fares than North American offerings, said Bernstein Research analyst Janet Brashear in a note.

Europe is a major growth area for Carnival and the company plans to expand capacity there by 12 percent in 2010. Overall capacity is expected to jump 7.7 percent.

But Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said the outlook for close-in bookings remained murky, and rising fuel costs and a resurgence of the H1N1 flu could hurt results. During the call, Carnival said the flu reduced net revenue yields by 1.4 points in the third quarter.

&quot;We remain cautious on the cruise stocks given our view that the cruise industry&apos;s long-term risks are not going away (lack of pricing power due to oversupply and the fuel conundrum),&quot; wrote Kent, who has a &quot;sell&quot; rating on Carnival.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Younger children will need two doses of the vaccine against the new pandemic of H1N1 influenza, U.S. officials said on Monday.

They said tests of Sanofi-Pasteur&apos;s swine flu vaccine showed children respond to it just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with children over 10 needing only a single dose but children under 9 needing two.

Separately, Sanofi said it had won a U.S. government order for 27.3 million more doses of its vaccine and AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune unit said the U.S. government has ordered 29 million more doses of its needle-free vaccine.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said young children will likely need to have their doses 21 days apart. But he said they could receive seasonal flu shots and H1N1 shots on the same day -- something that could ease the logistics of vaccinating children multiple times.

&quot;As we had hoped, in children the 2009 H1N1 vaccine is acting just like the seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Fauci told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Children aged 10 to 17 mounted an immune response that should protect them from H1N1 within 8 to 10 days, Fauci said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 46 U.S. children have died from swine flu, which appears to have first emerged in Mexico in March and which spread around the world to cause a pandemic in only six weeks.

As soon as the new virus was identified, the U.S. government and companies started making a vaccine against it and testing began in August to ensure it was safe and to determine what dose would be needed.

About 25 companies globally are now making H1N1 vaccine.

The United States had ordered 195 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Australia&apos;s CSL, MedImmune and Novartis. With the new orders from Sanofi and MedImmune, that would make more than 250 million doses.

MORE TO GO AROUND

Most countries ordered H1N1 vaccine with the expectation that two doses would be needed, so many now have more than anticipated.

The CDC has designated about 160 million people to be vaccinated first, including pregnant women, people with heart disease, asthma or diabetes and school-aged children.

With seasonal flu vaccine, children under 9 who are getting a flu vaccine for the first time need two doses, so Fauci said it is likely that young children who have never had a flu vaccine before will need four doses this year -- two seasonal flu doses and two swine flu doses.

But that may not mean four visits to a clinic or doctor&apos;s office, the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said. &quot;We do expect, based on what we know about vaccines, that it should be fine for the shot to be given on the same day,&quot; she said.

It gets a bit more complicated with MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray vaccine, she said. Children getting that needle-free vaccine will likely need to get FluMist, the seasonal version, separately from the swine flu formulated nose spray.

H1N1 is now the dominant strain of influenza circulating globally and Fauci said it is possible it may replace the seasonal form of H1N1 also circulating.

&quot;If you look at the history of where new viruses come in, frequently what they do is come back the next year and displace one or even more than one of the circulating strains,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a distinct possibility that this might ultimately be incorporated into a seasonal flu vaccine.&quot;

By Deepa Seetharaman

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp &amp; Plc (CCL.N) (CCL.L) lifted its 2009 earnings forecast on Tuesday and said ticket prices for its cruises were stabilizing, boosting shares of the world&apos;s largest cruise operator as much as 9 percent.

Bookings for the next three quarters were 19 percent ahead of 2008 levels, spurred in part by heavy discounting. Travelers are also booking cruises earlier, which has helped rates stabilize, Carnival noted.

Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said during a call that rates were unlikely to fall further in the fourth quarter, given the strength of late bookings.

&quot;For a limited number of itineraries ... we have been able to move prices up,&quot; added Frank, who also acts as Carnival&apos;s vice chairman.

Frank said 2010 would likely be a stable year, but rising unemployment and the housing crisis remained major obstacles to a full recovery.

&quot;It is going to be a fairly stable environment, maybe slightly improving, but nothing more than that,&quot; he said.

Carnival expects to earn between $2.16 and $2.20 per share in 2009, an increase from its earlier range of $2.00 to $2.10. The company sees a 14 percent drop in net revenue yields, a key measure of revenue performance in the industry.

The company added that fuel prices would be higher than forecast in 2009, costing the company 5 cents per share. This would be partially offset by a weaker dollar, which would contribute 3 cents per share.

Shares of Miami-based Carnival spiked 7 percent to $34.27 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. Its main rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) (RCL.OL), saw its stock jump 4.1 percent to $24.20.

Carnival&apos;s credit default swaps tightened on Tuesday, meaning that it cost less to insure the company&apos;s debt against the risk of default than late last week, traders said.

THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS BEAT ESTIMATES

For the third quarter, ended Aug. 31, Carnival reported a net profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Revenue sank more than 14 percent to about $4.1 billion. Net revenue yields fell 16.4 percent, while costs, including fuel, fell 11.4 percent.

Carnival benefited from a 39 percent drop in fuel costs.

In the fourth quarter, Carnival expects earnings of 16 cents to 20 cents per share. On average, analysts expect 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Shares of Carnival, which are components of the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 indexes, have doubled since early March amid signs that economic recovery is under way.

In the third quarter, European cruises saw smaller declines in fares than North American offerings, said Bernstein Research analyst Janet Brashear in a note.

Europe is a major growth area for Carnival and the company plans to expand capacity there by 12 percent in 2010. Overall capacity is expected to jump 7.7 percent.

But Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said the outlook for close-in bookings remained murky, and rising fuel costs and a resurgence of the H1N1 flu could hurt results. During the call, Carnival said the flu reduced net revenue yields by 1.4 points in the third quarter.

&quot;We remain cautious on the cruise stocks given our view that the cruise industry&apos;s long-term risks are not going away (lack of pricing power due to oversupply and the fuel conundrum),&quot; wrote Kent, who has a &quot;sell&quot; rating on Carnival.

WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Younger children will need two doses of the vaccine against the new pandemic of H1N1 influenza, U.S. officials said on Monday.

They said tests of Sanofi-Pasteur&apos;s (SASY.PA) swine flu vaccine showed children respond to it just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with children over 10 needing only a single dose but children under 9 needing two.

As soon as the new virus was identified, the U.S. government and companies started making a vaccine against it and testing began in August to ensure it was safe and to determine what dose would be needed.

About 25 companies globally are now making H1N1 vaccine.

The United States had ordered 195 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi, Australia&apos;s CSL (CSL.AX), MedImmune and Novartis NOVN.AX. With the new orders from Sanofi and MedImmune, that would make more than 250 million doses.

MORE TO GO AROUND

Most countries ordered H1N1 vaccine with the expectation that two doses would be needed, so many now have more than anticipated.

The CDC has designated about 160 million people to be vaccinated first, including pregnant women, people with heart disease, asthma or diabetes and school-aged children.

With seasonal flu vaccine, children under 9 who are getting a flu vaccine for the first time need two doses, so Fauci said it is likely that young children who have never had a flu vaccine before will need four doses this year -- two seasonal flu doses and two swine flu doses.

But that may not mean four visits to a clinic or doctor&apos;s office, the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said. &quot;We do expect, based on what we know about vaccines, that it should be fine for the shot to be given on the same day,&quot; she said.

It gets a bit more complicated with MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray vaccine, she said. Children getting that needle-free vaccine will likely need to get FluMist, the seasonal version, separately from the swine flu formulated nose spray.

H1N1 is now the dominant strain of influenza circulating globally and Fauci said it is possible it may replace the seasonal form of H1N1 also circulating.

&quot;If you look at the history of where new viruses come in, frequently what they do is come back the next year and displace one or even more than one of the circulating strains,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a distinct possibility that this might ultimately be incorporated into a seasonal flu vaccine.&quot; (Additional reporting by David Morgan and Bill Berkrot, editing by Vicki Allen and Cynthia Osterman)</body>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Younger children will need two doses of the vaccine against the new pandemic of H1N1 influenza, U.S. officials said on Monday.

They said tests of Sanofi-Pasteur&apos;s swine flu vaccine showed children respond to it just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with children over 10 needing only a single dose but children under 9 needing two.

Separately, Sanofi said it had won a U.S. government order for 27.3 million more doses of its vaccine and AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune unit said the U.S. government has ordered 29 million more doses of its needle-free vaccine.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said young children will likely need to have their doses 21 days apart. But he said they could receive seasonal flu shots and H1N1 shots on the same day -- something that could ease the logistics of vaccinating children multiple times.

&quot;As we had hoped, in children the 2009 H1N1 vaccine is acting just like the seasonal flu vaccine,&quot; Fauci told reporters in a telephone briefing.

Children aged 10 to 17 mounted an immune response that should protect them from H1N1 within 8 to 10 days, Fauci said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 46 U.S. children have died from swine flu, which appears to have first emerged in Mexico in March and which spread around the world to cause a pandemic in only six weeks.

WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Younger children will need two doses of the vaccine against the new pandemic of H1N1 influenza, U.S. officials said on Monday.

They said tests of Sanofi-Pasteur&apos;s (SASY.PA) swine flu vaccine showed children respond to it just as they do to seasonal flu vaccines, with children over 10 needing only a single dose but children under 9 needing two.

The United States had ordered 195 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five makers -- GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Australia&apos;s CSL, MedImmune and Novartis. With the new orders from Sanofi and MedImmune, that would make more than 250 million doses.

MORE TO GO AROUND

Most countries ordered H1N1 vaccine with the expectation that two doses would be needed, so many now have more than anticipated.

The CDC has designated about 160 million people to be vaccinated first, including pregnant women, people with heart disease, asthma or diabetes and school-aged children.

With seasonal flu vaccine, children under 9 who are getting a flu vaccine for the first time need two doses, so Fauci said it is likely that young children who have never had a flu vaccine before will need four doses this year -- two seasonal flu doses and two swine flu doses.

But that may not mean four visits to a clinic or doctor&apos;s office, the CDC&apos;s Dr. Anne Schuchat said. &quot;We do expect, based on what we know about vaccines, that it should be fine for the shot to be given on the same day,&quot; she said.

It gets a bit more complicated with MedImmune&apos;s nasal spray vaccine, she said. Children getting that needle-free vaccine will likely need to get FluMist, the seasonal version, separately from the swine flu formulated nose spray.

H1N1 is now the dominant strain of influenza circulating globally and Fauci said it is possible it may replace the seasonal form of H1N1 also circulating.

&quot;If you look at the history of where new viruses come in, frequently what they do is come back the next year and displace one or even more than one of the circulating strains,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a distinct possibility that this might ultimately be incorporated into a seasonal flu vaccine.&quot;

By Deepa Seetharaman

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp &amp; Plc (CCL.N) (CCL.L) lifted its 2009 earnings forecast on Tuesday and said ticket prices for its cruises were stabilizing, boosting shares of the world&apos;s largest cruise operator as much as 9 percent.

Bookings for the next three quarters were 19 percent ahead of 2008 levels, spurred in part by heavy discounting. Travelers are also booking cruises earlier, which has helped rates stabilize, Carnival noted.

Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said during a call that rates were unlikely to fall further in the fourth quarter, given the strength of late bookings.

&quot;For a limited number of itineraries ... we have been able to move prices up,&quot; added Frank, who also acts as Carnival&apos;s vice chairman.

Frank said 2010 would likely be a stable year, but rising unemployment and the housing crisis remained major obstacles to a full recovery.

&quot;It is going to be a fairly stable environment, maybe slightly improving, but nothing more than that,&quot; he said.

Carnival expects to earn between $2.16 and $2.20 per share in 2009, an increase from its earlier range of $2.00 to $2.10. The company sees a 14 percent drop in net revenue yields, a key measure of revenue performance in the industry.

The company added that fuel prices would be higher than forecast in 2009, costing the company 5 cents per share. This would be partially offset by a weaker dollar, which would contribute 3 cents per share.

Shares of Miami-based Carnival spiked 7 percent to $34.27 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. Its main rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) (RCL.OL), saw its stock jump 4.1 percent to $24.20.

Carnival&apos;s credit default swaps tightened on Tuesday, meaning that it cost less to insure the company&apos;s debt against the risk of default than late last week, traders said.

THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS BEAT ESTIMATES

For the third quarter, ended Aug. 31, Carnival reported a net profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Revenue sank more than 14 percent to about $4.1 billion. Net revenue yields fell 16.4 percent, while costs, including fuel, fell 11.4 percent.

Carnival benefited from a 39 percent drop in fuel costs.

In the fourth quarter, Carnival expects earnings of 16 cents to 20 cents per share. On average, analysts expect 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

Shares of Carnival, which are components of the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 indexes, have doubled since early March amid signs that economic recovery is under way.

In the third quarter, European cruises saw smaller declines in fares than North American offerings, said Bernstein Research analyst Janet Brashear in a note.

Europe is a major growth area for Carnival and the company plans to expand capacity there by 12 percent in 2010. Overall capacity is expected to jump 7.7 percent.

But Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said the outlook for close-in bookings remained murky, and rising fuel costs and a resurgence of the H1N1 flu could hurt results. During the call, Carnival said the flu reduced net revenue yields by 1.4 points in the third quarter.

&quot;We remain cautious on the cruise stocks given our view that the cruise industry&apos;s long-term risks are not going away (lack of pricing power due to oversupply and the fuel conundrum),&quot; wrote Kent, who has a &quot;sell&quot; rating on Carnival.
