    <description>A cough, in medicine, is a sudden and often repetitively occurring defense reflex 
    which helps to clear the large breathing passages from excess secretions, irritants, foreign 
    particles and microbes. The cough reflex consists of three phases: an inhalation, a forced 
    exhalation against a closed glottis, and a violent release of air from the lungs following 
    opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound. Coughing can happen v
    oluntarily as well as involuntarily, though for the most part it is involuntarily.

Frequent or severe coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease.
